"Britain's interests have been damaged by an attitude to Europe that has been, at best, ambivalent and, at worst, hostile.",108,51421,199705

"Scotland’s institutions in the law, education, administration and in sport still have their distinctive national characteristics despite a constant erosion by the Westminster Parliament.",301,51902,199705

Over the past few years the SNP and Scotland have been subject to a whole range of smears and fears manufactured by political opponents.,0,51902,199705

"SCOTLAND, ON INDEPENDENCE, WILL AUTOMATICALLY BECOME A FULL MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION:",108,51902,199705
"European legal , political and constitutional opinion on this matter is quite clear.",108,51902,199705
SCOTLAND WILL HAVE OPEN BORDERS WITH ENGLAND:,601,51902,199705
modern European countries have abolished controlled internal frontiers and our close family and trading ties with England will not be interrupted in any way by Scottish Independence.,601,51902,199705
"Only political union will end - our social union will be as strong as ever, and indeed improved by our new equal status as good neighbours.",301,51902,199705
PENSIONS AND INVESTMENTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY INDEPENDENCE:,504,51902,199705
the European Union already legislates for such transfers.,108,51902,199705
SCOTLAND WILL ESTABLISH A MODERN EFFICIENT AND APPROPRIATE DEFENCE FORCE in keeping with our traditions and best practice throughout our continent.,104,51902,199705
Scotland does not need nuclear weapons.,105,51902,199705
THERE WILL BE FULL CITIZENSHIP AND A CONTINUING RIGHT OF RESIDENCE FOR EVERYONE WHO CURRENTLY LIVES HERE.,201,51902,199705
"An Independent Scotland will protect in its written constitution residency rights for all those living here , or entitled to live here, at the time of independence whether or not they become Scottish Citizens.",201,51902,199705
Citizenship will be established on the basis of residency or birth.,201,51902,199705
Membership of the European Union will also permit residence from citizens from other European Union members.,108,51902,199705
"SCOTLAND WILL BECOME A WEALTHIER, FREER NATION FOR ALL ITS CITIZENS:",201,51902,199705
Scotland today is being kept held back by the Union with England.,602,51902,199705
An independent Scotland will be a magnet for investment and our “Bill of Rights” will protect every citizen from government interference,201,51902,199705
- something that Britain does not do,602,51902,199705
- and establish social justice in our land.,503,51902,199705
NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE is the normal status for wealthy small nations.,301,51902,199705
Over 50 countries have become independent from Britain since 1945 and NONE of them have applied to become colonies or dependencies again.,301,51902,199705
Nearly half the independent nations in the world are smaller than Scotland,301,51902,199705
- 25 out of the 35 most prosperous nations are small nations!,301,51902,199705
SCOTLAND WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE ANY GOVERNMENT IT LIKES AFTER INDEPENDENCE:,202,51902,199705
"in the first elections after independence the SNP will stand as a political party, but Scots will be able to choose any party they like.",202,51902,199705
Proportional Representation will ensure that Scottish governments are broadly based and that all parts of the country are fairly,202,51902,199705
represented - as will be women and ethnic minorities.,503,51902,199705
A vote for the SNP is a vote for Independence,301,51902,199705
"- it is also a vote to encourage change, because only when the SNP is strong do the other parties pay any attention to Scotland .",305,51902,199705
Constitutional Change has been promised to Scotland by the British parties for over 100 years - but nothing has happened.,305,51902,199705
"Nothing will happen unless the SNP is strong and determined, and attracting the support of the people of Scotland.",305,51902,199705
"New Labour’s scheme for a Scottish assembly is fatally flawed, and will deliver no real power.",305,51902,199705
The Tories are stuck in the bunker of “no change” whilst virtually the whole of Scotland is now scunnered by their anti-Scottish actions.,305,51902,199705
"Only the SNP offers a clear , logical and achievable blueprint for progress.",305,51902,199705
Scotland can regain its independence at any General Election.,301,51902,199705
"After the election of a majority of SNP MPs,the SNP will immediately initiate negotiations for independence with the UK government.",301,51902,199705
"In parallel with these negotiations, we will initiate talks with the European Union in order to facilitate the right conditions for independent representation.",301,51902,199705
At the conclusion of this period (which is likely to take between six and twelve months) the people of Scotland will be asked to approve the “independence settlement” in a simple one question referendum.,202,51902,199705
"On achieving the assent of the people of Scotland, independence will be declared and, after the formal establishment of an independent country within Europe,",301,51902,199705
a fresh General Election will be held to elect a new government.,202,51902,199705
There are many precedents for such a process: indeed during 1996 a committee of respected academics brought forward the final report of a study of Scotland’s route to independence5 which clearly set out the steps to be followed.,301,51902,199705
During this study examples from other parts of the world were looked at closely.,107,51902,199705
"In the twentieth century the road to Independence is well trodden, and well signposted by those that have gone before.",107,51902,199705
An independent Scotland will have a written constitution and Bill of Rights.,203,51902,199705
"This means that Scots will be citizens, not subjects.",201,51902,199705
"They will be protected from the type of arbitrary interference that is the hallmark of Westminster government,",602,51902,199705
and they will be able to force the state to honour its commitments to them.,202,51902,199705
Almost every country in the world has a written constitution:,203,51902,199705
and virtually every democratic country in the world makes sure that citizens are guaranteed their rights.,201,51902,199705
A modern Scotland must have the same concern for law and liberty .,201,51902,199705
Earlier this year the SNP published its full constitutional proposals 6 which have been arrived at after lengthy and wide ranging consultation.,203,51902,199705
"The protection of basic human rights, including the right of free expression and assembly, the right to housing , education and free health care and the right to decent working conditions and a minimum wage.",201,51902,199705
"The rights of citizens in an independent Scotland will be at least as wide-ranging as those offered under the European Convention on Human Rights, which will be incorporated into the law of Scotland.",201,51902,199705
The establishment of a single chamber parliament elected by proportional representation which is modern in character,202,51902,199705
"and which in gender, ethnic origin and geographical representation accurately mirrors Scottish society as a whole.",503,51902,199705
The franchise will be extended to include all those aged 16 and over.,202,51902,199705
"Legislation will require public consultation, may be initiated by public petition as well as by members of the Scottish Parliament,",202,51902,199705
and a system of strong standing committees will supervise and regulate proceedings.,605,51902,199705
"Final legislation, having passed the Parliamentary process, will be approved on behalf of the people by the Chancellor of the Parliament,",202,51902,199705
not subject to the mumbo jumbo of Royal assent.,602,51902,199705
"The balanced parliament, elected fairly, and a strong investigative committee system",202,51902,199705
will replace the offensive and archaic House of Lords as the mechanisms to ensure properly thought through legislation.,602,51902,199705
Membership of a legislative body secured only by accident of birth or political patronage has no place in a modern democracy.,304,51902,199705
"The SNP propose the reform of the Monarchy which, while allowing the Queen and her successors to remain Head of State, would ensure that their duties and payments were clearly and openly understood.",202,51902,199705
In the absence of the Queen from Scotland the elected Chancellor (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament will act as Head of State.,202,51902,199705
The protection of the rights and responsibilities of Local Government will be protected by means of entrenchment in the constitution.,301,51902,199705
Local Authorities will also be elected by proportional representation.,301,51902,199705
"Citizens of Scotland, wherever they have come from, will be full participants in a twenty first century democracy,",202,51902,199705
not subjects of an outmoded and decaying eighteenth century state.,602,51902,199705
That change alone will refresh and invigorate Scottish life.,606,51902,199705
Independence is vital for our future; but independence is not an aim on its own.,301,51902,199705
The purpose of independence is not just to free Scotland but to free Scots - all the people who live in Scotland,606,51902,199705
"The Tory Government has been responsible for a vast increase in the National Debt, and an Independent Scotland would of course inherit a proportion of that debt, estimated to be around £38 billion.",305,51902,199705
"An SNP Government would commence a programme of repaying this debt , aiming to reduce the amount spent in interest and to free resources for further investment in the future.",414,51902,199705
The debt repayment will amount to a total of £6. 6 billion in the first four years of Independence.,414,51902,199705
The SNP aims for full employment -,408,51902,199705
"an achievable goal that is integral to the growth of the Scottish economy,",410,51902,199705
the delivery of a high standard of living,504,51902,199705
and the development of a secure and inclusive society in which every individual contributes and plays a constructive role.,606,51902,199705
"The SNP’s four year budget will result in the creation of  an additional 100,000 new jobs;",408,51902,199705
in addition our National Apprenticeship scheme will increase the number of young people going on from school to meaningful training and through that route into useful work.,411,51902,199705
"In addition to the immediate jobs boost that independence will produce,",301,51902,199705
the creation of new jobs will come about as Scottish business is assisted to develop and compete.,402,51902,199705
"The key to such development will be the introduction of a sensitive and targeted corporate tax structure, allied to important initiatives to encourage small businesses that do not pay corporation tax.",402,51902,199705
The SNP is the only party in a generation to enter a General Election fully committed to a reduction in business taxation.,402,51902,199705
Cut the standard rate of corporation tax by approx. 10% from 33p to 30p,402,51902,199705
Cut the small companies rate of corporation tax by 22% from 23p to 18p,402,51902,199705
Limit the increase in the Business Rate Multiplier to the increase in the RPI,402,51902,199705
Phase in banded business rates with benefit targeted at smaller enterprises and with no increase for larger companies.,402,51902,199705
Abolish Class IV National Insurance Contributions.,402,51902,199705
These proposals will be phased in over a four year period.,402,51902,199705
We have allocated an average of £250 million per year from our budget for the creation of a Business Tax Reduction fund to pay for these measures.,402,51902,199705
"In addition to a innovative business tax regime,",402,51902,199705
"Government funding will be provided for priority economic projects such as industrial expansion, modernisation, agricultural diversification and the introduction of new technologies.",411,51902,199705
An additional £120 million over four years will be provided to enhance research and development of new products and processes.,411,51902,199705
"This will ensure that full advantage is taken of the intellectual capacity and scientific and technological innovation that is to be found in rich abundance in our universities and colleges, and in many of our businesses.",411,51902,199705
A Scottish Export Unit will also assist in building our export trade and focusing the attention of Scottish industry on the need to expand its excellent record in this field and will provide a massive boost to the international profile of Scottish business.,410,51902,199705
A Scottish Skills Foundation will be established to bring international best practice in skills and innovation training to bear on Scottish business and industry.,411,51902,199705
"The SNP has budgeted for a doubling of the Scottish Tourist Board’s advertising and promotions budget and will assist the Tourism industry - which contributes in excess of £2.2 billion to the Scottish economy and employs over 177,000 people - to fulfil its potential.",410,51902,199705
"With the SNP’s commitment to Defence Diversification (see Chapter 9),",104,51902,199705
to a modernised transport and communications infrastructure (See Chapter 8),411,51902,199705
"and with a successful Scottish approach to attracting investment the prospects for job creation and business birth, growth and survival will be better than ever before.",410,51902,199705
An SNP government will provide a context for business that is fair and flexible:,403,51902,199705
a Merger and Take-overs panel will ensure competitive practices and prevent “asset stripping” which has destroyed many Scottish companies over the past 20 years;,403,51902,199705
"a Fair Trading Unit within a Scottish Department of Industry, Technology and Employment will inherit and strengthen the responsibilities of the current utility regulators",403,51902,199705
and legislation will ensure that the practice of delayed payment that damages small businesses is outlawed.,403,51902,199705
A fair and flexible business environment will flourish if accompanied by active partnership with trade unions:,405,51902,199705
the SNP Charter for Trade Unions will guarantee Trade Union rights whilst ensuring that their responsibilities are enforceable at law.,405,51902,199705
Scottish endorsement of the EU Social Chapter will encourage Unions and employers to observe best practice that enhances constructive and profitable co-operation.,405,51902,199705
The introduction of a minimum wage (after discussion and with consensus) set at half median male earnings will be accompanied by an implementation plan developed in association with employers which assists smaller businesses to take this vital social step forward.,412,51902,199705
"For those in work, a fair personal tax system is an essential motivator:",503,51902,199705
the SNP aim to introduce a starter rate of income tax at 15p over the first four years of government.,503,51902,199705
For middle income earners the bands of income at which the basic rate is levied will be expanded by 15 per cent.,503,51902,199705
"This means that the top rate will not kick in until earnings exceed £30,000.",503,51902,199705
"In keeping with the belief that those who are best rewarded should contribute slightly more in order to assist delivering a just society , the ceiling on National Insurance contributions will be removed.",503,51902,199705
"Taken together these proposals will mean that there will be a drop in taxation for most, with a marginal increase in taxation for those earning above £26,500 per year.",503,51902,199705
85% of male employees and 95% of female employees will pay less tax.,503,51902,199705
But all will benefit from a more prosperous country and a fairer society.,606,51902,199705
These proposals are in keeping with the basic Scottish belief in progressive taxation and the sharing of responsibility according to the ability to pay.,503,51902,199705
"We will also cut VAT on Domestic fuel from 8% to 5% , the minimum allowed under EU regulations",503,51902,199705
"but will also negotiate with the EU to seek a new regime to take account of climatic conditions in Northern Europe, thus allowing the eventual abolition of this tax.",503,51902,199705
Move toward full employment,408,51902,199705
Achieve sustained growth along with increased investment,410,51902,199705
Secure continuing low inflation,414,51902,199705
Establish International Economic Credibility,410,51902,199705
Introduce a competitive business tax system,402,51902,199705
Legislate for a fair personal tax system,503,51902,199705
Build exports and inward investment,410,51902,199705
Strengthen the infrastructure and skills base,411,51902,199705
Adopt the Social Chapter and the Minimum Wage.,412,51902,199705
Introduce the SNP Charter for Trade Union Rights,405,51902,199705
"Job creation, business growth and economic success at home and abroad are aims that Scotland should aspire to given its wealth of talents and its strong resource base.",410,51902,199705
"But those underpinning strengths in the Scottish economy must also give rise to the development of social justice, education for life, health and public services which the Scottish people need and deserve.",504,51902,199705
Scots should be encouraged to take advantage of arts and leisure opportunities and to have their lives enriched by such pursuits.,502,51902,199705
And all these developments must take place in society that is determined to be free of crime and its effects.,605,51902,199705
The Scottish National Party is commited to a socially just Scotland,503,51902,199705
- the type of Scotland which the Tories have systematically tried to destroy for 18 years:,305,51902,199705
A Scotland in which poverty is eradicated and those in need are assisted to the maximum degree possible;,504,51902,199705
the Scotland that all Scots want.,606,51902,199705
"In our society there will always be a need for supporting those who cannot work, either through incapacity or for a variety of short-term reasons.",504,51902,199705
Government must also use the benefits system to assist those who are vulnerable,705,51902,199705
"- the very young, the old and those who are incapacitated",706,51902,199705
- and to eliminate the effects of poverty.,503,51902,199705
An SNP government will increase Child Benefit to £12.50 per week per child and maintain entitlement until a child has left school.,504,51902,199705
Child Benefit is a powerful means of tackling poverty as it is paid directly to the child’s principal carer.,504,51902,199705
The annual cost of this measure wil £132 million by year 4 of an independent government.,301,51902,199705
"Benefit will be restored to 16 and 17 year olds immediately, as the Tory removal of such benefits has been a strong contributory factor in the rise of youth homelessness and youth crime.",706,51902,199705
"Education and training - with proper financial support - is the best way to assist young people,",506,51902,199705
but they must not be put in the position of suffering poverty and alienation because society will not assist them.,503,51902,199705
The SNP is strongly committed to eradicating the scourge of fuel poverty particularly so as Scotland is an energy rich nation.,503,51902,199705
Our “Pensioners Package” already forms the basis for action of fuel poverty for SNP councils:,504,51902,199705
we will ensure that the entire package is implemented at a national level - a package that will increase the state retirement pension by £3 a week for a single person and £5 a week for married couples as a first step towards achieving parity with the higher European pension levels;,504,51902,199705
introduce a Cold Climate Allowance of £9. 20 for all pensioners and others on benefits;,504,51902,199705
"remove standing charges from electricity, gas and telecom services for pensioners;",504,51902,199705
and abolish means testing for the residential care of elderly.,504,51902,199705
These measures will provide real relief from hardship and enhance social justice.,503,51902,199705
"In particular, the removal of standing charges provides a much more efficient and targeted way of making privatised utilities contribute to society than a one-off “windfall tax”,",403,51902,199705
while the abolition of means testing will remove a major indignity from old people and allow them to enjoy the fruits of their retirement without undue worry or stress.,504,51902,199705
Social justice also requires a new approach to the Scottish Health Service.,503,51902,199705
"The SNP will first of all establish an independent Health Commission, chaired by the Health Minister, which will consist of representatives of all political parties in the Scottish Parliament along with health professionals and representatives of local health care delivery agencies.",303,51902,199705
"Within the context of the health budget set by government, this commission will plan the strategic delivery of health services.",504,51902,199705
Local Health Commissions will undertake a subsidiary role in local planning of health care.,301,51902,199705
The SNP believe that free health care at the point of need is a fundamental right,201,51902,199705
and in order to provide such care we must remove the distorting distraction of the Tories’ internal market in the health service.,305,51902,199705
"By removing the tiers of accountants, administrators and middle managers we will abolish the artificial split between purchasers and providers of health care and will introduce an integrated health system which is administered and planned nationally but delivered locally.",301,51902,199705
This structural change is important - as is providing additional resources and finding a way in which the broad strategic priorities for health can be taken out of the day to day political arena.,504,51902,199705
"We will provide an additional £35 million per annum for the Scottish Health Service which, coupled with savings on bureaucracy (which consumes a staggering 12% of NHS expenditure) will provide a major and immediate boost for healthcare delivery.",303,51902,199705
The SNP will establish an on going national audit of health care designed to provide creative feedback and raise local and national standards.,202,51902,199705
Dentistry will be re-integrated into the NHS and we accept the view of the dental profession that capitation fees must be adjusted to take account of Scotland’s dental health needs which are greater than those elsewhere in the UK.,504,51902,199705
This and other measures will encourage dentists to return to the Scottish Health Service.,402,51902,199705
"Prescription charges have increased, under this Tory government, from 20p to the current £5.65.",305,51902,199705
The system can be effectively reformed both by allowing patients to pay the real cost of drugs if these are below the prescription charge levels and by spreading the burden of charges more fairly.,504,51902,199705
The SNP will review the issue of charges and exemptions for those with long term mental illness who are not presently allowed exemptions.,504,51902,199705
Health care in a modern Scotland must be preventative as well as curative.,504,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will ban cigarette advertising and increase tobacco tax both to encourage more to give up, or not to start smoking, and to recover a small proportion of the costs of treatment of tobacco related illnesses by the National Health Service.",412,51902,199705
"We will also prioritise the improvement of nutritional standards in Scotland, using best practice both to encourage healthy eating and to protect the nation’s health by enforcing high standards in the production and distribution of food.",504,51902,199705
Care in the community is a laudable aim but it requires support with resources and with an infrastructure that the Tories have constantly eroded.,305,51902,199705
"The SNP will ensure that Local Health Commissions review the local delivery of care in the community, allocating resources to it as required.",504,51902,199705
"The provision of care in the community has a direct bearing on adequate local government funding, and statutory obligations imposed on local government must be backed up with financial provision.",301,51902,199705
So must any need to increase the involvement of voluntary organisations who are key facilitators in the provision of care.,504,51902,199705
The cost of democratic control of the Health Service through such Commissions will be considerably less than the present “internal market” which lacks both democracy and efficiency.,303,51902,199705
"As many as one in 10 of the world’s population suffers some form of disability,",705,51902,199705
"but society is still reluctant to legislate to ensure full civil rights for disabled people,",201,51902,199705
and to improve the quality of life so that all disabled people can fulfil their potential and contribute to the society of which they are members.,606,51902,199705
"The SNP will introduce measures, in the Bill of Rights and in other legislation, to secure full rights,",201,51902,199705
to enforce standards of building access and to help disabled people obtain and retain employment as they wish and are able.,504,51902,199705
"The SNP will implement its “Charter for the Disabled” to enable valuable members of society who are presently often excluded from the mainstream, but who have much to contribute.",606,51902,199705
"Whilst food safety is not primarily a health issue, until structures, controls and procedures go wrong, there is a clear need now to restore the reputation of the Scottish food industry and to provide a mechanism for public control of food quality.",412,51902,199705
"The SNP has been in the forefront of the campaign for an independent food safety agency, free of the pressure from the producers and able to take a proactive stance in securing the highest standards.",412,51902,199705
An independent Scottish Food and Consumer Health Agency will have a wide remit:,412,51902,199705
"it will supervise public health issues, working through local authorities and through local public health departments;",412,51902,199705
it will regulate food processing and handling and introduce clear controls that will better the European norm;,412,51902,199705
"it will consider public nutrition and health issues in their broadest sense and will assist in the process of promoting better eating , recognising that one of the principal barriers to a healthy diet is poverty.",504,51902,199705
It will also work closely with the producers to instil the best practices and provide a certification of quality that in time will be the passport to domestic and international success for the Scottish food industry.,412,51902,199705
Freedom from crime is an important freedom for many Scots;,201,51902,199705
"and whilst crime levels in Scotland have fallen in recent years many communities are still subject to unacceptable levels of vandalism, burglary and violence.",605,51902,199705
The SNP has supported initiatives that seek to reduce crime by means of a “zero tolerance” approach:,605,51902,199705
we will encourage such initiatives throughout Scotland and support them with additional resources for Scotland’s police forces.,605,51902,199705
"“Zero Tolerance” brings improvement to communities by focusing attention on community crimes such as vandalism, petty burglary and other such anti-social activities.",605,51902,199705
By so doing it increases community confidence and pride.,606,51902,199705
It is an ideal solution for every part of Scotland and particularly for urban areas.,605,51902,199705
There are many practical steps that can be taken to cut down on petty or organised crime against property.,605,51902,199705
"One such scheme, which has been vigorously promoted by the SNP and which has the support of a number of organisations, is one which combats the £1.3 billion used-vehicle fraud that takes place every year.",605,51902,199705
A register of vehicles will be established which will allow purchasers of second hand vehicles to check that their intended purchase is legitimate.,605,51902,199705
The cost added to a purchase will be around £5.00 but the peace of mind afforded will be great.,605,51902,199705
Much police time is wasted for want of such simple and cost effective solutions:,303,51902,199705
much is also wasted in waiting for court appearances and the court system needs better resourcing.,303,51902,199705
The Procurator Fiscal service needs more lawyers and support staff and a stronger training infrastructure.,411,51902,199705
The solution to the problem of crime in Scotland does not lie in more prisons and more mandatory sentences:,605,51902,199705
these proposals have been rejected by the judiciary and by most commentators and it is an indictment of government in the last decade that our prison population is at its highest ever level - and still rising.,605,51902,199705
What is needed is a range of alternatives to prison and a flexible sentencing policy coupled with schemes for education and rehabilitation that actually work.,605,51902,199705
To implement and operate  such schemes the justice system must be encouraged to learn from international best practice and the SNP proposes the establishment of a research and development facility within a Scottish University to develop and implement education and rehabilitation schemes.,605,51902,199705
"The basis of community action against crime must lie in the community, and the SNP opposes the establishment of an all Scottish police force,",606,51902,199705
although we endorse the move towards sharing of skills between forces and the establishment of national strategic initiatives where appropriate.,605,51902,199705
"Scotland should never lose sight of the link between poverty, social deprivation and crime.",503,51902,199705
"Accordingly, whilst crime must be tackled at source, the creation of a better and fairer society will also have a strong impact on crime levels.",503,51902,199705
An economy that produces more jobs and more meaningful work for the people of Scotland will pay dividends in this area as well.,504,51902,199705
A major cause of criminal activity lies in the drugs culture that has developed in parts of Scotland.,605,51902,199705
"But drug abuse, like crime, is also a symptom of something wrong in our society, that needs to be put right.",606,51902,199705
"Yet there is not one drugs problem, but many.",605,51902,199705
And a variety of tactics are required to deal with them.,605,51902,199705
What needs to be put right first is the question of demand.,605,51902,199705
"If demand for drugs in society is curtailed, then the drug problem will diminish.",605,51902,199705
Tackling demand can vary from better resourced customs and police to more effective rehabilitation programmes in prisons and to drug education in schools.,605,51902,199705
All such measures are supported by the SNP which has been active in the all party campaign “Scotland against Drugs”.,605,51902,199705
Solving Scotland’s drug problems also requires the collection of much information about drug use including much better recording of criminal statistics on drug related offences.,605,51902,199705
"The SNP also supports, and will encourage, local initiatives including Drugs Action Teams.",301,51902,199705
The whole world was shocked by the Dunblane tragedy;,605,51902,199705
but Scotland’s call for action to ban all hand guns and to tighten restrictions on all other weapons was ignored by the Tory government.,605,51902,199705
"The SNP will introduce a total ban on handguns , making Scotland a safer place",605,51902,199705
and taking a major step towards eradicating the “gun culture” which is creeping into our country.,606,51902,199705
This measure will be accompanied by appropriate compensation for those deprived of their pastime,503,51902,199705
and the SNP will enforce the Cullen recommendations in all other areas of firearms control.,605,51902,199705
As a nation we must do our utmost to ensure that every step is taken to prevent another Dunblane.,606,51902,199705
"These measures, and the more stringent screening of firearm applications along with the establishment of a national register of firearms holders, will be a significant step towards that aim.",605,51902,199705
"Just as crime, social justice and health are priorities for Scotland, so are Education, Housing, Local services and arts and leisure provision.",503,51902,199705
"These community services, usually delivered at local level, need to be enhanced and improved if the quality of life in Scotland is to be enhanced and improved.",503,51902,199705
Labour’s so-called “Passion for Education” is a sham when the actual resources that are being offered  are examined closely.,305,51902,199705
In contrast the SNP has firmly costed changes that can be made immediately to the Scottish Education system.,506,51902,199705
Scotland’s crisis in Education is the result of under funding;,305,51902,199705
"attempts to pin the blame on poor teaching, on the curriculum or on any other factors fail to take account of the constant erosion of morale and physical resources that has taken place in the last 18 years.",305,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will provide the extra resources to immediately employ an additional 700 teachers, and devote new resources to the repair and upgrading of school buildings.",506,51902,199705
"Both these actions are priorities, in order that class sizes can be reduced and classes taught in acceptable surroundings.",506,51902,199705
"Local Authorities, as the Education providers, need resourced adequately to undertake their tasks:",301,51902,199705
the SNP in offering additional resources to local authorities across a wide range of fields will ensure that the local authorities also prioritise education and are sensitive to local need;,301,51902,199705
there is no demand for “opting out” in Scotland and consequently the “opting out” legislation will be repealed.,506,51902,199705
However schools will be assisted to control more of their budgets themselves and to involve the school board in financial decision making.,506,51902,199705
Primary and Secondary schools will be enabled to take advantage of new technology and there will be guaranteed access to the Internet from each school as well as a programme to introduce computers into every classroom with the ultimate aim of all children using a computer terminal every day.,506,51902,199705
"Education is not just about schools: an SNP Government will introduce an entitlement to free nursery education for all 3 and 4 year olds whose parents wish it, and will make certain that such provision is properly funded.",504,51902,199705
The voucher system will be abolished.,503,51902,199705
"At the other end of the educational spectrum an SNP Government will support the Higher Education sector,",506,51902,199705
"first of all by replacing the Student Loans system with a return to maintenance grants at the 1990 equivalent, index linked for successive years.",504,51902,199705
Higher Education will have access to the Economic Development and Research Funds earmarked by an SNP Government as well as to the advice and assistance of the Exports Unit.,506,51902,199705
We support the establishment of a Scottish Education and Training Export Group to co-ordinate the overseas marketing of Scottish expertise in this area.,506,51902,199705
"For those who do not go on to Higher Education an SNP Government will improve training and skills development and introduce a Integrated Training and Employment Grant Scheme ,",411,51902,199705
"providing subsidies to employers taking on new employees in need of training, preferably the unemployed.",402,51902,199705
Training schemes of this nature should not merely rotate the unemployed into temporary positions.,411,51902,199705
We will add £50 million per year to the present youth and adult training budgets presently managed by Scottish Enterprise guaranteeing additional adult and youth training places.,411,51902,199705
In keeping with the multi cultural society in which we live,607,51902,199705
education in an independent Scotland will involve learning about the wide range of factors that have created our present society,506,51902,199705
and will look outwards to our European and world partners.,107,51902,199705
Gaelic and Scots have a place to play in this process and will be enhanced by such an approach.,607,51902,199705
"Gaelic medium education is of particular importance to many parents,",506,51902,199705
"and an SNP Government will require local authorities to ring fence dedicated funds for Gaelic medium education, as is presently done in Wales for Welsh language education.",607,51902,199705
The SNP is also sensitive to the needs of other communities which are part of the rich tapestry of Scotland.,607,51902,199705
"Schools with pupils from Moslem families must offer Islamic studies to such pupils as a matter of course,",607,51902,199705
"and the same applies to other communities which wish to take part in Scottish education, but which also wish to retain and develop their distinctive nature.",607,51902,199705
Scottish education will be enriched by such provision.,506,51902,199705
These policies are all necessary parts of the process of improvement that Scotland needs.,506,51902,199705
"There are three final parts which require to be considered: housing, local services and arts and leisure provision.",504,51902,199705
For many years there has been a deplorable lack of investment in Scotland’s housing.,305,51902,199705
The result is a housing crisis with increased levels of homelessness and longer and longer council waiting lists.,305,51902,199705
"The Scottish Housing Conditions Survey has shown that too many of our citizens are forced to live in housing that is damp, overcrowded, poorly insulated and often lacking basic amenities.",706,51902,199705
"90,000 Scottish homes are deemed to be below tolerable standard and one third are affected by damp, condensation or mould.",706,51902,199705
An SNP Government will address this atrocious state of affairs by:,504,51902,199705
"Transferring Capital Debt: 75 percent of local authority housing debt will be transferred to Central Government in the first four years of an independent government, with the remainder being transferred in the following four years.",302,51902,199705
From a public expenditure commitment of £985 million this will release over £1.6 billion for investment over four years to tackle housing problems and housing need as well as other social priorities.,504,51902,199705
This one action should make a substantial start to solving Scotland’s housing crisis.,504,51902,199705
"Eliminating Homelessness: Between 1978 and 1994 445,283 households applied to local authorities as “homeless”.",706,51902,199705
This is a national disgrace and needs to be attended to as a matter of urgency.,504,51902,199705
"So does the situation in which, as Shelter estimate, there are up to 1000 rough sleepers in Scotland on any one night.",706,51902,199705
An SNP Government will strengthen the existing Code of Guidance on Homelessness and ensure that in meeting the demands of the Code no one is left without a home in time of need.,504,51902,199705
"Build Homes and Raise Standards With the money released by the capital debt transfer up to 20,000 socially affordable homes can be built in the first four years, and a further 35,000 homes can be brought back from below tolerable standard.",504,51902,199705
"160,000 homes can be treated for dampness and condensation.",504,51902,199705
By applying higher standards of insulation money spent on upgrading can quickly be recouped in terms of energy expenditure.,504,51902,199705
"Some 300,000 houses have been bought under the Tory “right to buy” legislation, usually at a discounted price.",305,51902,199705
This has left a disproportionate number of council houses in poor condition as the best of the stock has been purchased.,305,51902,199705
It would be illogical to increase investment in socially affordable housing if it was then simply to be sold at a discount.,504,51902,199705
New or improved houses coming on stream from the building and renovation programme will be protected from the right to buy at a discounted price.,504,51902,199705
Those with existing tenancy agreements will however retain the right within the homes they presently occupy.,201,51902,199705
A right to buy at full market value will continue for all tenants.,504,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will replace Scottish Homes with a new accountable housing agency whose remit will be to deal with Scotland’s housing problems, improve Scotland’s housing stock and provide affordable housing.",412,51902,199705
Housing Associations and other bodies have a valuable role to play in these objectives and must be involved in policy formulation and in delivery.,202,51902,199705
The SNP is the only party which has costed a full programme of action to tackle Scotland’s housing crisis.,305,51902,199705
"Such a programme will not only begin to eliminate homelessness,",504,51902,199705
it will also create many new jobs and provide a boost for the Scottish economy.,410,51902,199705
It will reduce housing waiting lists and move Scotland towards the provision of a home for all.,504,51902,199705
Those living in a better Scotland have a right to expect better local services.,301,51902,199705
"An SNP Government, having protected the autonomy of Local Government in a written Constitution,",203,51902,199705
"will expect local authorities to ensure that local services are efficient, effective and well targeted.",301,51902,199705
"As Scottish local authorities will be elected by proportional representation,",202,51902,199705
the monolithic and unresponsive one party states that Labour has created in many parts of Scotland will be consigned to the past.,305,51902,199705
"Local Government will have restored to it many of the powers lost to unelected quangos and there will be a review of the strategy and organisation of local economic development, with the aim or restoring local democratic control.",301,51902,199705
Local Government finance will be reformed during the first term of an independent Scottish government and the introduction of local income tax in a subsequent term will remove the anomalies that presently bedevil local funding.,301,51902,199705
Further adjustments to the support mechanisms for rural and island authorities would even out the support of local government by central government.,301,51902,199705
An SNP Government would abolish the Water Quangos and return water and sewerage to democratic control.,301,51902,199705
"Finally, arts and leisure provision are vital to the well being of society.",502,51902,199705
An SNP Government will encourage a programme of ‘sport for all’ and will back that policy up by the provision of affordable community sports facilities managed by local authorities.,502,51902,199705
There will be ministerial responsibility for sports development and in addition to community participation it will be a policy aim to encourage international competitiveness and success.,502,51902,199705
Scotland’s cultural life is of enormous importance and must be underpinned by an effective Scottish broadcasting system and a raft of public support that opens,502,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will reform Scottish Broadcasting , building on the tradition of excellence that exists but ensuring that Scottish programme making and Scottish concerns are at the heart of an internationally forward looking service.",502,51902,199705
We will retain a licence fee to support a public sector broadcaster (the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation ) but would encourage a diversity of commercial broadcasting on television and radio including at least one Scottish digital multiplex for a commercial service in the short term.,502,51902,199705
"Recognising that the age of effective protectionist broadcasting regulation is over, we would seek to ensure that the diversity of broadcasting channels observe the legal requirements of taste and decency while offering a wide range of services, and opportunities for Scottish based programme makers.",502,51902,199705
"Such services must include provision in Gaelic and Scots, but such provision must be accessible to wider audiences also.",607,51902,199705
"The SNP wishes to see a strong Scottish media production industry, which also means a strong Scottish film production sector.",502,51902,199705
"The introduction of tax incentives for production along the Irish model has been closely examined by the SNP in recent years, as has experience from elsewhere.",402,51902,199705
"An SNP government will introduce incentives for production and,",402,51902,199705
"through a new “Scottish Screen” (formed as a federation of film supporting, marketing and production orientated bodies ) will lay the basis for a renaissance in script and project development, commercial and non commercial production, marketing, distribution, exhibition and export of film.",502,51902,199705
The work of the Scottish Arts Council requires adequate Government support but we wish to see the refocussing of the priorities of the Arts Council to support people and traditional arts as well as long established institutions.,502,51902,199705
"A “Scottish Academy” will be established, encouraging excellence and bringing forward new talent in the arts.",502,51902,199705
"Gaelic and Scots must be given equal status with English, both legally and in broadcasting and the arts.",607,51902,199705
A Scottish Lottery would be established ( under the title “Scot-Lot”) with a more accountable system of distributing funds.,503,51902,199705
The jackpot payouts would be smaller but the chances of winning would be considerably higher.,503,51902,199705
"Scratch cards would be banned, given the problems of addiction and social disruption they cause.",503,51902,199705
"“Scot-Lot” resources would be available for a wide range of projects, but would not replace government funding for social services.",504,51902,199705
"They could be used for health research in addition to sports, charitable and arts purposes.",504,51902,199705
These many changes to Scottish life would make life in an independent Scotland a better experience for many of our fellow citizens.,606,51902,199705
The fact that all these proposals have been costed and can be afforded by an independent Scotland should indicate to all Scottish voters that our constitutional choice is clear and can be made in confidence.,301,51902,199705
A better Scotland in which all our citizens can live and work is the ambition and the intention of the Scottish National Party.,606,51902,199705
But the benefits of such a Scotland have to reach to every part of our country and in so doing any political party has to address other issues and concerns that arise,606,51902,199705
"- issues of traditional industries,",408,51902,199705
"special local concerns,",301,51902,199705
the environment,501,51902,199705
and the needs of Scotland’s island and rural communities.,301,51902,199705
Land is the most valuable resource of a nation: but Scotland’s system of land ownership and tenure is amongst the most archaic in the western world.,503,51902,199705
The SNP has accepted the proposals of the Independent Land Commission to abolish feudal tenure.,503,51902,199705
"The system of feudal overlords has been widely abused and has led to depopulation, massive profits for individuals who care nothing for the land and the people and insecurity for those who thought they had a title to their homes.",503,51902,199705
"It has no place in a modern country, and during the period of its abolition we will consult widely, at home and abroad, to create a modern and fair system of land holding that matches the best to be found anywhere.",503,51902,199705
We will establish a standing Scottish Land Commission to oversee the abolition of the old and the introduction of the new.,412,51902,199705
"Its membership will be representative of, and nominated by, local communities, land use interests, Members of the Scottish Parliament and Local Government representatives.",412,51902,199705
There are also interim and urgent measures that can be taken to outlaw abuse of the feudal system prior to a complete change in the law.,605,51902,199705
One such measure requires only the amendment of two century old Acts of Parliament to prevent ownership of local authority education buildings reverting to those who have speculatively purchased feudal superiorities.,503,51902,199705
We will  also transfer the powers of the Crown Estate Commissioners and other private owners of the sea shore and inshore seabed to local councils and local councils will be empowered to promote balanced land use and local access.,301,51902,199705
"We will also establish an all Scotland Land Register which will give open access to all enquirers and banish forever the mystery of land ownership behind which many have hidden in recent years, to the detriment of local communities.",403,51902,199705
Scotland’s farmers have been hard hit in recent years by successive Tory failures and by a growing neglect of the importance of the agricultural sector.,305,51902,199705
"Scotland, as a sparsely populated country, needs a strong agricultural base",703,51902,199705
and that base can contribute greatly to Scottish exports and to the international reputation of our nation.,410,51902,199705
The agricultural sector already contributes 3% of GDP.,410,51902,199705
The Scottish farming community will be best represented by a seat at the top table in Europe for the country in which they live and by an independent Scottish government:,703,51902,199705
"our farmers and farming communities are presently of minor concern to any UK government, as the BSE crisis has shown.",703,51902,199705
"The SNP promoted a Scottish solution to the EU ban from day one, but the British government has refused to countenance such relief for Scottish beef farmers and the Scottish beef industry, even when invited to by the European Union.",305,51902,199705
"A tracability scheme can be introduced into the Scottish herd within a matter of months , giving Scottish beef producers the platform they need for re-entry.",703,51902,199705
Ending the ban is the first priority;,703,51902,199705
then we must work to restore our reputation in Europe.,108,51902,199705
No independent Scottish government would ever have allowed BSE to gain such a foothold,301,51902,199705
and our regulatory and animal health regime must become the best in the world again.,605,51902,199705
The Independent Scottish Food Agency will be a partner of the agricultural sector in restoring the domestic and international trade,412,51902,199705
and will also work with producers to instil and enforce the best practices in the world.,605,51902,199705
"Agricultural policy is not, of course, based only on what has gone wrong in the past:",703,51902,199705
"Scottish agriculture has tremendous strengths, rooted in the skills and experience of those who passionately care for the land and for the future of their businesses.",703,51902,199705
We need to develop a sustainable agricultural sector in Scotland.,703,51902,199705
We need to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure that support goes to those working the land as opposed simply to products and sectors.,703,51902,199705
"We need to develop new techniques, innovate in husbandry and production and widen the access to modern machinery, by supporting machinery rings.",411,51902,199705
"We must also promote sensitive rural diversification ( which will be paid for out of a rural development fund amounting to some £10 million per year) and sectors of the industry such as horticulture so that, with fair competition within the EU, we can widen the scope of Scottish agriculture and broaden the financial rewards.",703,51902,199705
A priority will be to assist Scottish producers to have more and better access to the wholesale market and to retail outlets.,703,51902,199705
The SNP’s commitment to Scottish agriculture is firm and clear.,703,51902,199705
"Scottish farmers, producers and all those who work in ancillary industries, can only have their priorities met by an independent Scottish government which places their concerns firmly on the European and domestic agendas.",301,51902,199705
"Forestry is also a considerable national resource, and one which can be better used for the benefit of all.",410,51902,199705
The SNP will promote the development of a sustainable Forest Industry in Scotland by establishing a National Forest Enterprise Board (replacing the Forestry Commission) to undertake the commercial management and development of Scotland’s national forests in accordance with the land use strategy agreed by the Scottish Land Commission.,412,51902,199705
"The key priority will be to double forest and woodland cover within 25 years, with a particular emphasis on native woodland.",410,51902,199705
This will not only have economic benefits but will also assist the environment by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide.,501,51902,199705
"In parallel with this development, the NFEB will work with the private sector to stimulate wood using industries , which deepened upon sustainable production from native tree species.",403,51902,199705
"Private forest ownership can be of great benefit but tax incentives for such ownership must be targeted towards those who intend to build forestry and the forest industries, not just shelter their money for a while.",402,51902,199705
"The SNP is also committed to greater recreational use of forests, and the Land Commission, in enabling better public land access, will be mindful of the need to secure sensible forest access as well.",502,51902,199705
"Crofter and tenant farmers have a role to play in forest development, treating” (where holdings allow) timber as a common crop.",703,51902,199705
But this will be suitable for a small minority of crofters only.,703,51902,199705
The SNP wishes to see the Crofters Commission transformed into a National Crofting Development Agency with the power to assist crofting in the Highlands and Islands and small land tenure elsewhere.,412,51902,199705
The great strength of crofting is its ability to keep populations on the land and to prevent consequent depopulation of vital areas.,703,51902,199705
"Crofting is a way of life, but rarely a principal occupation.",703,51902,199705
"Accordingly assisting crofters to purchase crofting estates should be done as part of an overall development scheme for those areas, where new employment can be provided in new enterprises as well as enhanced crofting opportunities.",703,51902,199705
"The crofting estates that currently belong to the Crown should be returned to the people who live on them,",301,51902,199705
"but the opportunity to develop vibrant communities on crofting estates should not apply only to those who, by accident of tenure, are tenants of the Crown.",503,51902,199705
Private ownership should also be subject to regulation for purchase under clear conditions.,403,51902,199705
"All the evidence in the history of the Common Fisheries Policy points to the harsh reality that the UK has been happy , more often than not, to trade off fishing interests for other goals in European policy.",305,51902,199705
Scottish fishermen have paid the price for that UK hypocrisy.,602,51902,199705
"An SNP Government would use its improved influence as a full Member State in negotiations for a new European fisheries policy to ensure that the founding principles of the original CFP , in particular relative stability, are permanent components of future fisheries agreements .",703,51902,199705
"The processing sector, which provides vital employment and has good opportunities for expansion, must be supported particularly in an environment where rival sectors, for example on the Humber, are being allocated significant public resources.",410,51902,199705
The Scottish Exports Unit will be of particular help to this sector.,410,51902,199705
The fundamental objective of the SNP fisheries policy is to create a well managed and properly conserved fishery.,703,51902,199705
The SNP proposes six fundamental reforms which would assist the Scottish fishing industry:,703,51902,199705
A new framework whereby coastal states with the greatest historic interests in specific fisheries would be able to take the key control and management decisions relating to the fisheries in the waters off their coasts in Regional Fisheries Management Councils.,703,51902,199705
"New measures for the processing sector seeking to promote continuity, security and stability of supplies , backed by assistance towards infrastructure costs, training packages and maximising the potential to add value to fisheries products.",703,51902,199705
A rigorous but fair policing regime enforceable equally in all EU waters.,703,51902,199705
Greater emphasis on technical measures to conserve fish stocks.,411,51902,199705
Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of research.,411,51902,199705
"* Priority to areas with a high degree of fishing dependence , population sparsity and peripherality to be built in to fisheries policy.",703,51902,199705
The SNP has allocated an additional £10 million per annum within the Independence Budget to achieve the following strategic objectives:,305,51902,199705
Levering the maximum benefit of EU financial assistance to coastal regions by committing an extra £5 million from government resources to structural support and socio-economic measures.,503,51902,199705
"Promoting fisheries products and marketing initiatives, stressing the health value of fish with an additional £800,000 spend co-ordinated by a new processing task force.",703,51902,199705
An additional £1.6 million for harbour and infrastructure improvements which will leverage additional European funds.,411,51902,199705
Improving the effectiveness of research.,411,51902,199705
"Scotland’s international reputation is as a clean nation, rich in land and water.",501,51902,199705
But in reality Scotland is now threatened by a number of environmental hazards.,501,51902,199705
We must ensure that Scotland’s environment is restored and our people given back a confidence in their surroundings.,501,51902,199705
"We must also put in place the best environmental standards, so that we cease to heedlessly waste resources, and instead contribute to the betterment of our planet and those with whom we share it.",501,51902,199705
The SNP will retain the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and will ensure that it is independent of the Executive and responsible to the Scottish Parliament.,501,51902,199705
"Establish stricter controls on pollution of the atmosphere, sea , inland waters and land.",501,51902,199705
"Control, develop and promote the means of environmental rehabilitation",501,51902,199705
Establish codes of practice for industry,403,51902,199705
"Ensure that there is full public consultation on, and enquiry into, the environmental impact of major projects and government policies.",501,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will also promote recycling, and contribute to global environmental protection.",501,51902,199705
As part of the overall strategy of government an SNP Government will establish and enshrine National Environmental Targets.,501,51902,199705
It goes without saying that no SNP Government would permit Nuclear Reprocessing to take place in Scotland.,501,51902,199705
Nuclear reprocessing at Dounreay would end immediately an SNP Government was elected and arrangements would be made for all nuclear material originating furth of Scotland to be returned to their country of origin.,501,51902,199705
Materials originating in Scotland will require to be stored in Scotland for as long as environmentally required.,501,51902,199705
"However, rather than this determination being seen as a threat to the people of Dounreay, it should be seen as a major opportunity.",504,51902,199705
"Employment in clean up, storage and decommissioning will be a long term prospect for many people;",504,51902,199705
many others will be employed in a new renewable energy research and development centre which will be established at Dounreay.,504,51902,199705
The vital resource of the 20th century has been energy.,408,51902,199705
"And in the 21st century energy self sufficiency, still more the ability to export energy or energy sources, will remain of great importance to any nation.",408,51902,199705
Scotland is an energy rich nation.,408,51902,199705
That fact alone should give us the confidence to face the future in the normal state of independence.,301,51902,199705
"But , as part of the bankrupt and out of date Union, we do not use our energy wealth wisely.",410,51902,199705
In fact our wealth is being squandered by Westminster.,301,51902,199705
An Independent Scotland will secure a division of North Sea oil assets based upon the latitude of 55o 50’ north or the international legal principle of equidistance.,107,51902,199705
"The Continental Shelf (Jurisdictional) Order already provides such a division, and this order dating from 1968 presently places operations in either an “English” sector (governed by English Law) or a “Scottish” sector (governed by Scottish Law).",301,51902,199705
"This division has been operated by successive Labour and Tory Governments and places 90% north sea output under “Scottish” control , a percentage that is growing as the exploitable reserves move north.",301,51902,199705
"All existing obligations to oil and gas operators will be honoured, and the SNP envisages no substantive change in the taxation regime so that there can be a clear, stable and continuing climate for the oil industry.",402,51902,199705
The policy of an SNP government will be to secure a sustainable and long term oil industry:,416,51902,199705
"even present estimates indicate that there is as much oil still to be extracted as has already been extracted, and an SNP government will encourage exploration to increase known reserves and to increase recoverability from existing fields.",410,51902,199705
"An SNP Government will seek to add value to Scotland’s energy resources , for example by ending the discriminatory pricing policies which mean that landing charges from Scottish gas fields can be anything up to 17 times those south of the border, a situation which has led to gas from the North Sea by-passing Scotland: the “Great Gas Robbery”.",408,51902,199705
"Failure to achieve a satisfactory resolution of this problem will result in an SNP government examining ways in which the gas network, instead of being owned by a single private company could be jointly owned by all companies with an interest in Scottish gas production and supply, with a guiding golden share held for the public good.",413,51902,199705
"In addition, development of petro-chemical activity that can build on Scottish land fall of Scottish resources will be encouraged.",402,51902,199705
"Whilst the Scottish coal industry has been decimated in recent years, coal still has a part to play in a balanced energy policy.",408,51902,199705
"Whilst the SNP wishes to see tighter controls on open cast mining,",403,51902,199705
"and a clearer environmental evaluation of each proposed project,",501,51902,199705
deep mining also needs to be re-examined with a view to accessing rich seams that have been abandoned too early and without reference to modern technology.,411,51902,199705
The SNP is resolutely opposed to Nuclear Power Generation:,501,51902,199705
"at present we have neither the ability to make it totally safe, nor the knowledge to be completely certain about long term effects, and long term problems.",501,51902,199705
An SNP government will introduce a programme to phase out nuclear generation in Scotland.,501,51902,199705
"The length of this phased programme will be planned to take account of new energy sources coming on stream, and on the safe methods of removing nuclear generation from our energy mix.",501,51902,199705
There are a number of sources of power in Scotland that are cheaper as well as more environmentally acceptable than Nuclear power and others are developing.,501,51902,199705
"To replace nuclear generation, Scotland requires to develop alternative energy sources that are renewable and sustainable.",501,51902,199705
"The SNP Budget contains an allocation of funding for this task, and also funding for schemes of energy conservation, which can reduce our demand significantly by reducing heating bills.",501,51902,199705
"Scotland needs an integrated transport network, that gives good access to all parts of the country, speeds goods and services,",411,51902,199705
and brings the nation closer together.,606,51902,199705
"There remains a need for some improvements to the road network, but we must also be mindful of the need to reduce overall car and lorry usage in the years ahead, particularly in our towns and cities.",411,51902,199705
"The solution to reduced car usage in particular lies in better public transport, and the SNP will invest in rail services ,",411,51902,199705
first of all by returning the Scottish assets of Railtrack into public ownership,413,51902,199705
"and then by modernising and electrifying the East Coast Line , commuter routes and branch lines.",411,51902,199705
Bus and Coach services are also vital and must be integrated with rail services.,411,51902,199705
Effective Bus and Coach transport can assist greatly in easing road congestion and regulation of bus operators should recognise the need to guide service development and delivery to achieve that end as well as to ensure the maintenance of vital links.,411,51902,199705
The SNP regards the tolls presently levied by the Skye Bridge as an unacceptable imposition on the people of Skye and as a great disincentive to the creation and preservation of employment.,503,51902,199705
"The SNP will , in the immediate term, replace the present tolls with “shadow tolls” and will take the bridge into public ownership within the first four years of an SNP government.",413,51902,199705
"The SNP will also move towards the removal of all tolls on Scottish bridges, and will not introduce tolls on any new or existing bridges or roads.",503,51902,199705
"Ferries are vital to Scotland’s communications infrastructure and the national Ferry company, Caledonian MacBrayne will be resourced to operate effective , economical services within Scottish waters",411,51902,199705
"and will be allowed to compete for services from Scotland, including services from a new East of Scotland ferry port.",411,51902,199705
"The SNP will abolish the Air Passenger Duty for the Highlands and Islands , as it unfairly discriminates against Scotland’s most remote communities and will modify it for other areas to reflect the cost of the fare rather than imposing a flat rate which works against much needed low cost air transport.",503,51902,199705
"In keeping with the need to encourage enterprise and development, we will remove unreasonable restrictions on international freight (the so called “fifth freedom”)",403,51902,199705
"and bearing in mind Scotland’s crucial geographical place for Air Traffic Control we will co-operate with our European partners on developing a pan national approach to air space regulation,",411,51902,199705
whilst developing and modernising our Oceanic Air Traffic Control centre.,411,51902,199705
"Scotland needs more direct air links with the world, and we will work with private operators to make these sustainable,",403,51902,199705
as well as assisting Scottish airports to provide high quality services easily accessible to passengers.,403,51902,199705
"A final area of opportunity for all of Scotland is the challenge of the global Telecommunications can not only connect parts of Scotland that would otherwise be remote,",411,51902,199705
"but it can and will also open Scotland up to the world, and the world to Scotland.",107,51902,199705
An SNP Government will strengthen regulation of monopoly suppliers in the Telecommunications Market whilst facilitating greater competition and embracing the drive towards common European and world standards.,403,51902,199705
"The SNP will support communications developments in rural areas, particularly in the Highlands and Islands,",411,51902,199705
and assist the University of the Highlands and Islands in establishing a world lead in distance learning by the Internet and other means.,506,51902,199705
Telecrofting and Telecommuting have a much to offer a country like Scotland and an SNP Government will explore tax incentives for individuals and businesses taking this route.,402,51902,199705
Such patterns of working reduce demand on city transport and facilities and should be encouraged.,411,51902,199705
"However, whatever policies an SNP Government follows it will not impact upon use of the Internet and global communications unless it also takes a strongly pro-active stance in encouraging domestic, educational and business access to , and use of, the information super highway.",411,51902,199705
The 21st century will be the century of information - information as a resource and as an empowering tool.,411,51902,199705
"Scots have spent too long following trends, rather than setting them, and an SNP Government will set as a policy objective the commercial support of the Internet so that Scottish companies can access, present themselves through, and provide service on the net",411,51902,199705
"and so that individuals and schools can integrate the world’s knowledge base in their own experience, and contribute to it.",411,51902,199705
"The rate of involvement in, and access to, the Internet should be regulated by commerce and competition, but the Government has a role in supporting Scottish endeavours in this field,",403,51902,199705
and enabling educational use.,506,51902,199705
"Scotland as a technology manufacturing base can gain a great deal by seeking always to be part of the cutting edge of technology,",411,51902,199705
"and this attitude to the Internet, allied with the encouragement of software manufacture and hardware assembly as core Scottish industries, will be assessed at regular intervals so that Government strategy can lead Scotland’s modern potential instead of dragging it down as is the case now.",411,51902,199705
"In keeping with an open and positive philosophy on net use and access, no new regulations on censorship or control will be introduced, but support will be given to a “ratings system” to prevent unwitting access .",403,51902,199705
However Scots Law will require to develop means of combating computer fraud and existing law needs to be examined to see if its scope can deal with abuse of individuals by computer means.,605,51902,199705
Professor Christopher Harvie once called Scotland “The invisible nation of Europe”.,0,51902,199705
It is time for Scotland to become visible again and to resume a place in the world.,107,51902,199705
An SNP Government would wish to make certain that Scotland’s traditional openness to Europe and the World again coloured all our international relations.,107,51902,199705
"With a secure independent Parliament at home,",301,51902,199705
the benefits of international cooperation and full and equal membership of international organisations would greatly strengthen Scotland’s ability to defend and promote its interests in a world that shrinks each day.,107,51902,199705
"Scotland will be a full member of the European Union, participating fully in the institutions of the Union.",108,51902,199705
As a small independent country Scotland can have considerable influence in a Europe which is increasingly dominated by small member states.,301,51902,199705
We will have full voting power in the European Council and the Council of Ministers.,301,51902,199705
These representatives would be in a position to advocate on Scotland’s behalf with the right of veto over any decisions affecting Scotland’s vital national interests.,301,51902,199705
"This is a far cry from the present powerlessness we endure,",301,51902,199705
and some considerable distance from the still powerless observer status that Labour proposes under its devolution plans.,305,51902,199705
An SNP Government will use our influence and voting power to gain the maximum benefits for Scottish industry and the Scottish people.,301,51902,199705
Our priority would be to enter into the negotiations on the new Common Fisheries Policy to get a better deal for Scotland’s fishing industry and to re-orientate the Common Agricultural Policy towards those who work the land.,703,51902,199705
We will ensure that rural and urban areas of Scotland receive maximum help from the appropriate EU funds.,301,51902,199705
Scotland’s representation in the European Parliament would double on Independence and the SNP will support the introduction of a Europe wide voting system for this Parliament to strengthen democracy.,202,51902,199705
In the interim we will introduce a proportional system for the first elections after independence.,202,51902,199705
We support extending the Parliament’s powers to include the proper scrutiny of the Council and the Commission.,202,51902,199705
"An Independent Scottish Parliament will elect Scotland’s Commissioner and of course Scotland would take its turn at the European Presidency, bringing substantial benefits to the nation.",301,51902,199705
"Scotland will require a cost effective , efficient and modern diplomatic presence in some of the world’s capitals.",107,51902,199705
"Most small nations do not attempt to emulate the imperial pretensions of the United Kingdom, but instead target their diplomatic effort where it will do most good.",107,51902,199705
"Scotland’s embassies and consulates will exist to promote Scottish trade and industry,",410,51902,199705
look after Scottish citizens,606,51902,199705
and represent the best of Scotland to the world.,107,51902,199705
"We already pay our share of the UK diplomatic budget, but receive little in return.",305,51902,199705
An Independent Scotland would get a much better return for this necessary expenditure.,301,51902,199705
"Independence means joining in, not staying separate.",107,51902,199705
"The real separatists are those who have put us in our present condition, for they do not allow us to take a full part in anything.",602,51902,199705
Scotland will be a full member of the Commonwealth,101,51902,199705
"and will use its membership both to promote international co-operation and to market its expertise,",410,51902,199705
particularly in the educational field where Scottish Universities and Colleges already have a good reputation.,506,51902,199705
Scotland will be a member of the Council of Europe which unites almost all nations on the continent.,107,51902,199705
"The Council is best known for its offshoot, the European Court of Human Rights, and an independent Scotland will fully support the Council and the Court and seek to assist in making its judgements and deliberations effective.",107,51902,199705
Scotland will be a member of the United Nations.,107,51902,199705
The Scottish UN Mission would be one of the two most important Scottish diplomatic postings (the other being the Scottish Permanent Representative to the EU),107,51902,199705
"and Scotland in membership of the UN will support peacekeeping, the development of aid, cultural and educational programmes and",107,51902,199705
- unlike many members - pay its dues while working for necessary reforms.,107,51902,199705
"Finally Scotland will seek to assist in the establishment of an Association of States of the British Isles which will include England, Wales and Ireland.",101,51902,199705
This grouping will work together on problems and possibilities that exist in our area and which can be helped by joint action.,101,51902,199705
No part of the UK has played such a central role in the defence of the realm as Scotland.,104,51902,199705
"Its military and naval traditions are well known, and the professionalism of its service men and women will be an enormous asset to an independent state.",104,51902,199705
At the date of independence all serving service personnel from Scotland will be given the opportunity to transfer to the Scottish Defence Forces.,301,51902,199705
The same guarantee will apply to all MOD personnel serving in Scotland.,301,51902,199705
"Conscription is neither necessary, desirable nor anticipated.",105,51902,199705
"Indeed, as modern defence rejects conscription and as it is more costly in many ways, conscription would be a backward looking cul de sac.",105,51902,199705
"Because of Scotland’s geographic position, vital assets and international perspective, a modern, efficient and appropriate defence structure can be established that will be professional, well resourced and well targeted to its tasks.",104,51902,199705
"The Scottish Army will require infantry battalions, a commando battalion, an armoured regiment, and the requisite combat support and combat supply service units.",104,51902,199705
"Stationed at existing barracks the Army will require 9000 regulars, 16000 regular reservists, 7000 national reserves and 2000 MOD civilians.",104,51902,199705
Traditional Scottish regiments will be restored wherever possible.,104,51902,199705
The Scottish Navy will require both surface and submarine craft based at Faslane and Rosyth with a berthing base at Lerwick.,104,51902,199705
"It will have 5000 regulars, 2000 regular reserves and 600 national reserves as well as 5000 MoD personnel.",104,51902,199705
The Scottish Air Force will have both fixed wing and helicopter capability.,104,51902,199705
"The main bases will be Leuchars, Kinloss, and Lossiemouth.",104,51902,199705
"There will be 6000 regulars , 3650 regular reservists, 400 national reserves and 2850 MoD civilians.",104,51902,199705
"The Scottish Defence Forces will prioritise joint services training, and support and command structures will be developed to avoid needless and costly duplication of effort.",303,51902,199705
A culture of inter service co-operation will be central to the Force’s philosophy.,104,51902,199705
"The traditions of Scottish units, built up over many years, will be fostered and maintained in the Defence Forces.",104,51902,199705
"An Independent Scotland will contribute to, and benefit from, international co-operation especially in peace keeping, training, and conflict resolution.",106,51902,199705
"In addition to the SNP’s support for an EU Common Security and Defence Policy we would participate in the Western European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and the Partnership for Peace.",106,51902,199705
A Peacekeeping college will be established in Scotland to instruct SDF and foreign personnel in the theory and practice of peace keeping and seek to place Scotland in the forefront of international peacekeeping efforts.,106,51902,199705
The SNP have a long standing objection to nuclear weapons.,105,51902,199705
"We will negotiate a phased but complete withdrawal of Trident from the Clyde and invest our savings from this costly , deadly and unnecessary nuclear deterrent in conventional defence as well as in other priorities including health and education.",105,51902,199705
An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO.,105,51902,199705
However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult.,105,51902,199705
We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO,105,51902,199705
but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations as a result of our other proposed international involvements already mentioned above.,104,51902,199705
Defence Industries in Scotland will be free to carry on their businesses in cooperation with firms outside Scotland.,401,51902,199705
"Their end user certifications will be subject to stringent scrutiny, but at the same time Scottish firms will have priority in tendering for SDF contracts within the constraints of EU legislation.",412,51902,199705
"Refit of the SDF navy will take place at Rosyth,",104,51902,199705
"and the rolling programme of equipment replacement should enhance the position of Scottish defence contractors who will, at last, have a national force to attend to",104,51902,199705
without being totally dependent on the lottery of UK defence procurement procedures run from distant and often deaf Whitehall.,305,51902,199705
"The SNP will also promote Defence Diversification , with funding already allocated in the SNP Budget.",104,51902,199705
"The highly skilled Scottish defence manufacturing companies, and their workers, will have a brighter future both in supplying the SDF and in being encouraged and assisted to expand their abilities and markets.",104,51902,199705
"It has been, and remains, a matter of shame that the UK, one of the richer nations of the world, is so miserly when it comes to international aid.",602,51902,199705
The UK presently falls far short of the agreed international target of 0.7% of GDP to be spent on international aid.,602,51902,199705
Indeed further recent cuts have taken the UK’s GDP share to below 0.3%.,602,51902,199705
"The SNP has budgeted for a steady growth from this low point (which we shall inherit), with the aim of reaching 0.7% in six years.",107,51902,199705
"This period will allow the development of the necessary infrastructure, both governmental and voluntary, to meet the challenge of overseas aid and relief work.",107,51902,199705
"Small countries in Europe lead the way in aid, relief and international assistance.",107,51902,199705
"Sweden, Norway and Denmark are good examples of different models that work well.",107,51902,199705
Scotland can be amongst them and with independence it will be.,301,51902,199705
This manifesto has laid out the main proposals of the SNP for the creation of an independent nation once again,301,51902,199705
"and the sensitive, compassionate and forward looking governance of that nation which the SNP believe can be delivered.",305,51902,199705
But plans would be worthless without the resources to pay for them.,305,51902,199705
"And because the SNP aspire to govern Scotland, we also plan in detail for our country.",305,51902,199705
That is why we publish with this manifesto a fully costed budget for the first four years of independence.,301,51902,199705
That budget takes account of the riches of Scotland and of the extra resources we can generate by a new approach to business and individual taxation.,410,51902,199705
"It lays out those areas in which we can re-order spending , switching resources from needless projects like Trident, to needed projects like new schools and hospitals.",504,51902,199705
"Whilst the accompanying document explains the budget measures in detail, the chart opposite gives the basic financial information and answers the questions:",0,51902,199705
Where is the money coming from?,0,51902,199705
Where is the money going?,0,51902,199705
It also gives that strong affirmation that Alex Salmond used in his introduction.,0,51902,199705
YES WE CAN!,301,51902,199705
On the 1st of May you will have the opportunity of using your vote to choose Scotland’s future.,202,51902,199705
"The SNP has laid out in this manifesto its plans and proposals, and - alone amongst the political parties - has clearly costed them .",305,51902,199705
"Also alone amongst the political parties, the Scottish National Party is offering a programme made for Scotland in Scotland:",301,51902,199705
a programme that uses Scottish resources and Scottish principles to solve Scottish problems.,301,51902,199705
Independence is the normal status for nations.,301,51902,199705
"More than half of the nations of the world are smaller than Scotland, and most are much poorer.",107,51902,199705
"Yet they have chosen independence, and not one would wish to give it up.",301,51902,199705
We can do so too - together.,606,51902,199705
“YES WE CAN”,301,51902,199705
Yes We Can be free:,301,51902,199705
Yes We Can be independent:,301,51902,199705
Yes We Can pay our way in the world.,107,51902,199705
"And yes, we must!",301,51902,199705
The SNP stands for Scotland.,601,51902,200106
We stand for Independence and,301,51902,200106
we stand for the people -all the people - who live in our rich country.,305,51902,200106
At the Westminster election the people of Scotland have a choice.,305,51902,200106
A choice between the Scottish National Party that stands for Scotland,601,51902,200106
and which campaigns for Independence,301,51902,200106
or the London parties which have failed our country for too long.,305,51902,200106
The election of SNP MPs to the Westminster Parliament is a vote for Scotland and a vote for Independence.,601,51902,200106
"A vote for MPs committed to win Independence,",301,51902,200106
and who will work to bring about Independence as quickly as possible.,301,51902,200106
It is also a vote to win more powers for the Scottish Parliament and,301,51902,200106
a vote for MPs who will always put Scotland first.,301,51902,200106
"The more SNP MPs elected to Westminster, the stronger the case for a referendum on Independence.",301,51902,200106
A majority of SNP MPs will trigger a referendum.,301,51902,200106
This means our country gets the chance to vote for Independence -,301,51902,200106
to complete the powers of our Parliament -,301,51902,200106
in a democratic referendum.,301,51902,200106
"In advance of that referendum, all SNP MPs will put the case for more and complete powers for the Scottish Parliament from day one in the Westminster Parliament.",202,51902,200106
To be effective the Scottish Parliament must have the ability to take the key decisions that matter to the people of this country.,301,51902,200106
SNP MPs will argue for what is in the Scottish interest at all times,601,51902,200106
and will campaign strongly against all anti-Scottish legislation and measures at Westminster.,601,51902,200106
The SNP has no split loyalty;,601,51902,200106
"we work first, last and always for the Scottish interest.",601,51902,200106
"The more SNP MPs elected to the Westminster Parliament, the more we can do for Scotland.",601,51902,200106
And every vote for the SNP is a vote for the strongest voice for our country.,305,51902,200106
Each and every SNP MP will go to Westminster with three key aims.,305,51902,200106
"Drive Scotland forward to Independence,",301,51902,200106
completing the powers of the Scottish  Parliament -,301,51902,200106
"The stronger our voice, the stronger we can be in making the case for Independence",301,51902,200106
delivered by a democratic referendum.,202,51902,200106
Deliver the best deal for Scotland -,601,51902,200106
"the larger the SNP presence in the House of Commons, the better chance we have of making sure that Scotland gets the best deal.",601,51902,200106
Protect Scotland from the worst failings of Westminster rule -,301,51902,200106
"the more SNP MPs, the greater the chance we have of stopping the next fuel tax hike",301,51902,200106
or the next attack on Scottish public spending.,301,51902,200106
"Independence can release the energy, potential and opportunities needed to transform our country and",301,51902,200106
"to build a vibrant, exciting future for our children.",301,51902,200106
"We have a vision of Scotland that is a just, caring and enterprising country",301,51902,200106
where individuals are able to get on in the world regardless of where they have come from.,301,51902,200106
We believe strongly that there is a modern role for Scotland’s democratic government as a keystone in building a modern Scottish society and economy.,301,51902,200106
"It is through our government that we can pool our collective resources as a society and focus them on delivering a healthy,",301,51902,200106
"well-educated people,",301,51902,200106
living in a 21 st century environment and,301,51902,200106
cared for in times of need.,501,51902,200106
Scotland already has a Parliament but that Parliament has very limited powers.,301,51902,200106
We stand for completing the powers of our Parliament –,301,51902,200106
removing powers over issues that remain in London,301,51902,200106
and bringing them back to Scotland and,301,51902,200106
equipping the Scottish people with the same powers as every other normal country in the world.,301,51902,200106
We stand for giving the people of Scotland the chance to vote for the power to decide where they spend the resources and revenue of Scotland.,301,51902,200106
To decide the amount of investment in public services they,301,51902,200106
want and the amount of benefits they wish to allocate to those in need.,301,51902,200106
All those powers are with London at present,301,51902,200106
and we stand for transferring them to the Scottish Parliament.,301,51902,200106
Government from London will never deliver what we stand for,301,51902,200106
and what the people of Scotland demand.,301,51902,200106
The SNP stands to change that.,301,51902,200106
Scotland has a wealth of potential as a country.,301,51902,200106
"We have all the ingredients to make a success of our economy and our society,",301,51902,200106
but we need the confidence in ourselves to make that success happen.,301,51902,200106
Normal status in the world is what Independence is about.,301,51902,200106
We stand for a modern vision to transform Scotland with 21 st Century Independence.,301,51902,200106
Scotland is a wealthy country and can afford to invest more in public services.,504,51902,200106
"However, we need to ensure that we can invest in the long term by using the benefits of Scotland’s wealth of resources.",301,51902,200106
"Scotland will send £7.7 billion to Westminster more than we will receive back over the two years to 2002, as we published in Scotland’s 21 st Century Opportunity - Government Expenditures & Revenues in Scotland 2000-2002.",301,51902,200106
We will establish the Scottish Fund for Future Generations (SFFG) as a means of securing that long-term investment.,504,51902,200106
By committing our surplus oil revenues to the SFFG we will lock up the benefits of years of plenty forever.,504,51902,200106
This fund will produce a sustainable stream of income for investment from the depletion of scarce natural resources.,416,51902,200106
The extent of this income will vary with the revenues committed and the rates of return on investment achieved.,416,51902,200106
The investment in the SFFG could be £4.9 billion in the next year alone.,504,51902,200106
The income from that one year’s investment could in turn be worth in excess of £390 million a year in-perpetuity assuming an 8 per cent benchmark real rate of return.,504,51902,200106
That money would be available for reinvestment in public services on a sustainable basis.,416,51902,200106
The income from the fund is projected to top £1 billion a year after five years and could reach £5 billion per year in time.,504,51902,200106
Norway is already achieving income levels of this order after only five years of operating such a fund.,504,51902,200106
We will also establish the Scottish Trust for Public Investment (STPI).,504,51902,200106
This will target low cost investment into public infrastructure by competing costly PFI/PPP financed projects out of the market.,504,51902,200106
"By operating on a not for profit basis, spreading risk and gathering expertise under one roof,",504,51902,200106
"together with a secure government income stream,",414,51902,200106
the STPI could cut the cost of capital compared to PFI in half.,504,51902,200106
This will release a massive amount of resources for re-investment into public service infrastructure.,504,51902,200106
The Scottish National Party believes that an Independent Scotland must have a written Constitution that clearly enshrines the rights and responsibilities of all those who choose to live in Scotland.,202,51902,200106
"In the context of EU citizenship, the SNP have an open and inclusive approach to Scottish citizenship.",108,51902,200106
"The automatic right of citizenship will be open to all those living in Scotland,",602,51902,200106
all those born in Scotland and,602,51902,200106
all those with a parent born in Scotland.,602,51902,200106
All others are free to apply.,602,51902,200106
"With Independence,",301,51902,200106
"the Queen and her successors will remain as Head of State of Scotland, as defined within the written Constitution,",203,51902,200106
subject to the democratic consent of the people in a referendum.,202,51902,200106
The Scottish National Party supports the introduction of proportional representation at all levels of government.,202,51902,200106
Public confidence in the quango system is at an all time low.,202,51902,200106
This is exacerbated by the failure of quangos and,202,51902,200106
ministers to be held accountable when they deliver poor performance.,202,51902,200106
We will examine the role and effectiveness of the current range of quangos with a view to abolishing the excessive number of quangos operating in Scotland,202,51902,200106
and to replace the quango state with a democratic state.,202,51902,200106
We will introduce measures to increase the control of the Scottish Parliament over appointments to,202,51902,200106
and performance of those quangos that will remain.,202,51902,200106
"In particular, we support the current Private Member’s Bill in the Scottish Parliament regarding scrutiny of Scotland’s quangos.",202,51902,200106
Independence will provide job security and new opportunities for civil servants -,704,51902,200106
"within the Scottish Executive,",704,51902,200106
Executive Agencies,704,51902,200106
and those UK departments employing staff within Scotland - to advance to the top of their profession.,704,51902,200106
The SNP believes in the right of free access to higher education.,506,51902,200106
"We support the complete abolition of tuition fees,",506,51902,200106
whether these are due up front or paid back after graduation.,506,51902,200106
As resources allow we will build on existing maintenance grant provision to re-create a decent maintenance grant,506,51902,200106
and remove the dependence on student loans.,506,51902,200106
"We are supportive of the additional recommendations of the Cubie Report,",506,51902,200106
in particular those relating to the restoration of state benefits,504,51902,200106
and our Westminster MPs will argue for this.,504,51902,200106
The SNP has a long-standing commitment to the reduction of the voting age and,202,51902,200106
would like young people from the age of 16 to have voting entitlement.,202,51902,200106
The SNP would progress towards full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.,706,51902,200106
The establishment of a powerful and independent Children’s Commissioner for Scotland is fully supported by the SNP,706,51902,200106
and is essential in promoting awareness of childrens’ rights and,706,51902,200106
challenging individual breaches of rights.,706,51902,200106
As part of our commitment to family life we will support agencies which offer assistance to couples seeking counselling,603,51902,200106
and help during times of difficulty.,603,51902,200106
The SNP wants all Scots to fulfil their potential.,506,51902,200106
We must draw out of each generation the very best that they have to give to their society and to themselves.,506,51902,200106
"We must value education for its own sake,",506,51902,200106
"but also because enterprise, creativity and ambition all flow from the results of successful and continuing education.",401,51902,200106
The SNP will help Scottish education to become internationally respected once again.,506,51902,200106
We will do that by taking education out of the political battleground,506,51902,200106
and bringing forward proposals to depressurise a system that has been over stressed by central prescription.,301,51902,200106
"We would impose a moratorium on further change in the classroom and in educational administration until we have established an Education Convention,",506,51902,200106
chaired by the Education Minister and comprising a wide range of representatives from across Scotland and from throughout education.,202,51902,200106
"It will have the responsibility of debating policy proposed by Government prior to the legislative process,",506,51902,200106
and on making recommendations for implementation,506,51902,200106
after it has been approved by Parliament.,506,51902,200106
It will compliment the work of Government and Parliament.,202,51902,200106
The Convention will be established in the first year of an SNP government.,506,51902,200106
Thereafter the SNP will bring forward for pre and post legislative consultation through the Convention three major priority initiatives:,506,51902,200106
"We will introduce a phased reduction of Primary 1,",506,51902,200106
2,506,51902,200106
"and 3 class sizes to 18 or below,",506,51902,200106
initially targeting areas of social deprivation.,705,51902,200106
"This will be done by increased investment in teachers,",506,51902,200106
schools,506,51902,200106
and materials.,506,51902,200106
We will end publication of selective information that leads to the compilation of misleading league tables which are increasingly seen as disruptive to the process of learning,303,51902,200106
and which produce no benefit for young people themselves.,706,51902,200106
We will also critically examine the present externally imposed target setting for,301,51902,200106
"schools and bring about a reduction in the burden of assessment on young people,",706,51902,200106
Teachers,506,51902,200106
and schools.,506,51902,200106
We will develop a system in which the professional judgement of teachers is the central element,506,51902,200106
and in which powers abrogated to others in these matters will be returned to the classroom.,506,51902,200106
We will start on a major programme of school refurbishment and,506,51902,200106
"repair, using the innovative opportunity created by the STPI that will enable us to do more work,",506,51902,200106
more efficiently.,506,51902,200106
The SNP is committed to the full implementation of the McCrone settlement,506,51902,200106
and this will greatly assist in developing a new atmosphere in Scotland’s schools.,506,51902,200106
We will re-examine the duties of parents with the aim of ensuring that they play a full partnership role with schools and take responsibility for their children.,603,51902,200106
"We shall also bring forward changes in formal parental representation in schools,",202,51902,200106
replacing the present School Board structure with new arrangements taking account of the already expressed views of COSLA and others.,506,51902,200106
"We will also pursue other measures, including:- restructuring Her Majesty’s Inspectorate to consist of a small core of professional managers supported in actual inspection by secondees from schools;",303,51902,200106
introduction of measures that will ease the transition between nursery and primary school;,506,51902,200106
delivery of appropriate and effective training for teachers in information and communication technology;,506,51902,200106
"creation of new guidelines on school closures, with a presumption against closure of rural schools except in clearly specified circumstances;",506,51902,200106
and production of high quality teaching materials,506,51902,200106
"on Scottish history, language and literature.",605,51902,200106
We will place a duty in law to provide Gaelic medium education,607,51902,200106
where there is reasonable demand and developing Gaelic medium provision in the primary and secondary sectors.,607,51902,200106
We will also conduct a legislative review of the provision of school transport.,506,51902,200106
We support positive steps to ensure that the particular needs of Catholic schools are recognised in professional training and development,603,51902,200106
and that the contribution of Catholic schools to the diversity and richness of the Scottish educational scene is fully realised.,603,51902,200106
We will ensure that the needs of ethnic minority groups are met in mainstream schooling,705,51902,200106
and that anti-racism is a core element in a child’s growing understanding of our multicultural society.,607,51902,200106
Other measures will include developing the concept of Community;,606,51902,200106
enhancing the role of community education;,506,51902,200106
assisting teachers to impart the essential elements of citizenship education through their professional development;,606,51902,200106
recognising that mainstream schools with an inclusive orientation are,606,51902,200106
the most effective means of meeting the needs of all learners who share an equal entitlement to be there;,506,51902,200106
properly supporting moves towards more inclusive education for those with special needs;,506,51902,200106
providing support and back up for teachers in difficult circumstances in the classroom;,704,51902,200106
and providing back up where indiscipline and truancy are significant problems.,605,51902,200106
We will create an economic climate to end unemployment.,408,51902,200106
"Our philosophy is based on building on Scotland’s strengths,",601,51902,200106
and tackling the weaknesses that inhibit growth.,410,51902,200106
"More than anything, we are determined to create a specific Scottish economic policy suited to the economic profile of our nation.",301,51902,200106
Our programme of infrastructure investment through the Scottish Trust for Public Investment,411,51902,200106
"will give Scots businesses improved access to world markets through a modern and reliable road,",402,51902,200106
"rail,",411,51902,200106
sea and,411,51902,200106
air network.,411,51902,200106
We will ensure Scotland does not get by-passed by the digital revolution by ensuring that Scotland has direct access to the internet and,411,51902,200106
broadband capacity throughout the country.,411,51902,200106
"And our focus on reskilling Scotland will work to ensure that one of the key ingredients of a successful economy, a highly educated, flexible and skilled workforce, is in place to allow both the growth of indigenous enterprises,",411,51902,200106
"but also to encourage the relocation of high-skill, value-added international investors to our country.",402,51902,200106
Economic development agencies must become more focused,303,51902,200106
and less bureaucratic.,201,51902,200106
They must be more accessible and less regulatory.,402,51902,200106
Their aim is to facilitate and add value to indigenous and incoming business.,303,51902,200106
They should stimulate not suffocate.,402,51902,200106
"Finally, because we believe in Scotland, because we stand for Scotland,",601,51902,200106
"we will be best placed to sell Scotland as a marketplace,",408,51902,200106
as a holiday destination,408,51902,200106
and as a key export partner.,408,51902,200106
"We will ensure that Scotland’s businesses get better and wider representation across the world,",402,51902,200106
and that every effort is made to promote Scotland as a world beating business,402,51902,200106
and tourist centre.,402,51902,200106
"To this end, we will bring the tourist agency into Scotland’s enterprise network.",402,51902,200106
Scotland’s tourism industry has been under-valued,408,51902,200106
and the Scottish Executive has completely mishandled attempts to revitalise the industry.,303,51902,200106
"A confident and quality industry aiming to achieve an ambitious expansion of business levels can be achieved, but only with the correct policy direction.",402,51902,200106
The two key strategic aims in developing the industry must be to market the product,402,51902,200106
and make access cheaper and simpler.,402,51902,200106
The recent structural changes to the Scottish Tourist Board and Visit Scotland recognise that change is required.,303,51902,200106
"However, much more remains to be done.",303,51902,200106
"Fundamentally, the organisation must move away from seeing itself as a regulatory body to being a marketing body, which sells the product of a holiday or break in Scotland, at home and abroad.",401,51902,200106
More effective marketing and the direct promotion of Scotland to replace the role of the British Tourist Authority is required.,401,51902,200106
We need to ensure that we maximise our profile in our key areas,408,51902,200106
not disperse our resources in peripheral ones.,408,51902,200106
Access to Scotland is fundamental.,411,51902,200106
The lack of a Scottish gateway airport is a clear impediment.,411,51902,200106
"Hence, there is a requirement to ensure that our marketing also dovetails with a transport strategy.",411,51902,200106
The SNP will campaign for better transport links for visitors to enter Scotland.,411,51902,200106
"The SNP at Westminster will press for devolution of the New Deal to Scotland,",301,51902,200106
and in government will refocus the millions of pounds invested in this programme to create a Better Deal by targeting people living in Scotland’s job black spots,701,51902,200106
"and providing additional training, support and encouragement for long-term and",701,51902,200106
youth unemployed.,701,51902,200106
"This will come as part of a project of national reskilling,",701,51902,200106
and will assist those who too often slip off the statistics and out of the New Deal programme.,701,51902,200106
The SNP has long supported a minimum wage set at half male median earnings.,701,51902,200106
SNP MPs at Westminster and an SNP government would support an immediate increase of the minimum wage to £4.36 for all Scots regardless of their age.,701,51902,200106
This is a 16°k increase on current levels compared to Labour’s proposal of a 9°k increase.,701,51902,200106
We would aim to achieve a similar increase for the following year.,701,51902,200106
We would end age discrimination and the minimum wage would apply for all Scots regardless of their age.,503,51902,200106
The lowest paid young Scots working a 40-hour week would gain £2350 a year extra under SNP plans.,701,51902,200106
Workers over 21 on the minimum wage would see an increase in income of £1350 a year.,701,51902,200106
Any such moves would follow discussion with employers and trades unions about implementation.,405,51902,200106
"Recognising the possible impact of a higher minimum wage on small businesses in Scotland, the SNP’s review of the tax system will develop measures to reduce employment costs for small businesses using the increased revenue that will accrue to the Exchequer from higher tax income resulting from a higher minimum wage,",403,51902,200106
"In the last UK Parliament, it was the SNP who stood for Scotland’s trades unions by pressing the case for fair ballots for trade union recognition in the workplace,",701,51902,200106
"in contrast to the government’s system, which meant a majority of votes did not mean recognition.",701,51902,200106
Our support for Scotland’s trades unions will continue.,701,51902,200106
We will guarantee the rights of trades unions,701,51902,200106
and the rights of representation for workers through a statutory Charter of Trade Union Rights.,701,51902,200106
We support the EU Directive on collective redundancies,701,51902,200106
and will argue strongly for the ratification of other employee involvement laws.,701,51902,200106
"The SNP stands for a clean, safe and sustainable environment in Scotland.",416,51902,200106
"With so many key industries - agriculture,",501,51902,200106
tourism,501,51902,200106
"and fisheries - dependent on Scotland’s environmental image,",501,51902,200106
maintaining and protecting our natural environment must be central to any government’s priorities.,501,51902,200106
An SNP government will strive to ensure that Scotland becomes a world leader in securing a sustainable environment,416,51902,200106
"and quality of life for all,",301,51902,200106
recognising that local action can have global impact and,501,51902,200106
that environmental problems do not respect national boundaries.,107,51902,200106
We will contribute towards international climate change targets.,501,51902,200106
We oppose the UK government climate change levy,501,51902,200106
and have particular concerns about its impact on hydroelectric power.,501,51902,200106
We will undertake an evaluation of the risks from climate change,501,51902,200106
and will produce a strategy to address these risks.,501,51902,200106
As a first step to securing this objective an SNP government will commission a State of the Nation Environmental Audit to assess Scotland’s current position.,501,51902,200106
"From this we will establish a National Environment Plan (NEP),",501,51902,200106
which will set stretching standards,501,51902,200106
"and targets to meet Scotland’s international obligations,",107,51902,200106
"and where appropriate, surpass these objectives.",501,51902,200106
"In the short term, at Westminster, we will press for SEPA to be given statutory monitoring powers over military facilities in Scotland so that there is proper environmental regulation of MoD practices such as the dumping of depleted uranium in the Solway Firth.",501,51902,200106
"In government the SNP will seek to ensure Scotland produces 12% of all its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2010,",501,51902,200106
including 25% of its electricity.,501,51902,200106
We will not build any more nuclear power stations.,501,51902,200106
Existing facilities will be decommissioned at the end of their economic or technical capacity.,501,51902,200106
"Dounreay will be supported as an international centre of decommissioning,",501,51902,200106
allowing Scotland to export its expertise.,107,51902,200106
"We are committed to the development of a resource efficient culture in Scotland, supporting the key concepts of the ""six Rs"" - Refuse, Reduce, Re-use, Refurbish, Recycle, Recover.",416,51902,200106
"The SNP is committed to the Precautionary and Polluter Pays Principles,",501,51902,200106
and in government will introduce an integrated system of pollution prevention and control.,501,51902,200106
"As part of our Comprehensive Tax Review, we will examine the system of Landfill Tax Credits.",501,51902,200106
An SNP government will undertake an immediate review of the water industry's financial arrangements bringing to an end sky-high increases in water charges and a halt to backdoor privatisation.,412,51902,200106
Suitable protection for low-income households,701,51902,200106
and the voluntary sector will be introduced.,606,51902,200106
The three water quangos will be given a more democratic and accountable structure.,202,51902,200106
"An exemption will be sought from the Competition Act, to allow the industry to cope with the significant challenges that it already faces,",402,51902,200106
and consider the implications of competition.,403,51902,200106
The SNP recognises that those who work in the health service are already committed to delivering real improvements,704,51902,200106
and we support them in their efforts.,704,51902,200106
We are also supportive of many of the initiatives published in the Scottish Health Plan.,504,51902,200106
The SNP’s policy platform is not an alternative to the initiatives that are already planned or underway.,504,51902,200106
What it does is identify key areas where the SNP believes that government could and should go further.,504,51902,200106
The SNP believes that the National Health Service is too important to be a political football.,504,51902,200106
"We will establish a National Health Care Commission (NHCC),",504,51902,200106
"chaired by the Minister for Health & Community Care with cross party representation of MSPs, representatives of the health profession and unions together with members of the wider community.",405,51902,200106
The Commission will be charged with setting the strategic direction for NHS Scotland,504,51902,200106
and given a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment.,504,51902,200106
"The NHCC will be instrumental in raising morale of health professionals,",704,51902,200106
"which is at an all time low,",704,51902,200106
not least in the primary care sector.,704,51902,200106
A recent survey of GPs in Scotland found that nearly 80% did not feel included in changes in the NHS.,704,51902,200106
That must change if there is to be a genuine partnership approach to improving our health service.,704,51902,200106
The Commission will also examine how local healthcare co-operatives can best be empowered to deliver real improvements.,504,51902,200106
Making Scotland a healthier place to live is at the heart of our policy platform.,504,51902,200106
Free fruit in schools.,504,51902,200106
We will target policies and resources in improving the health of Scotland’s children and encouraging in our young people -,504,51902,200106
and hopefully their parents,504,51902,200106
-a culture of healthy eating.,504,51902,200106
We will extend on a national basis the practice of a few local authorities of providing free fruit in schools,504,51902,200106
"and will provide, during term time, a free daily portion of fruit to every primary school pupil in Scotland.",504,51902,200106
2.  Healthier school meals.,504,51902,200106
- which for many children is the main meal of the day,706,51902,200106
- to ensure that the food children eat at school meets minimum nutritional standards.,504,51902,200106
The SNP is committed to restoring a system in which access to health care is determined by a professional assessment of clinical need,504,51902,200106
and not by the lottery of a patient’s residence.,503,51902,200106
The SNP pledges to end postcode treatment within our first term in government.,504,51902,200106
No patient will be denied access to a drug or treatment that has been positively assessed by the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS).,504,51902,200106
The SNP will substantially increase the budget of the HTBS to enable it to expand its workload,504,51902,200106
and increase the number of assessments that it carries out each year.,504,51902,200106
The findings of the HTBS will be binding on health boards.,504,51902,200106
The NHCC will have a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment.,503,51902,200106
It will be for the Commission to identify instances where the care and treatment of patients in any area falls significantly below that in other areas.,503,51902,200106
The NHCC will be empowered to work pro-actively with the relevant health bodies to ensure that effective action is taken to bring the quality of care up to acceptable standards.,303,51902,200106
The SNP in government will re-introduce free dental check ups for everyone in Scotland.,504,51902,200106
The SNP will act to end the unfairness inherent in the prescription charges system.,503,51902,200106
"We will freeze the level of prescription charges immediately,",504,51902,200106
"and establish an independent, short-term working party to review the level of charges and the categories of exemption.",303,51902,200106
We support and will continue the drive to set and maintain national standards of clinical excellence.,504,51902,200106
We will take action to ensure that patients are treated as quickly and as close to home as is possible,504,51902,200106
"and clinically appropriate,",504,51902,200106
"and in settings that are clean,",504,51902,200106
"modern,",504,51902,200106
properly staffed,504,51902,200106
and well equipped.,504,51902,200106
Our early priorities will be to invest in reequipping NHS Scotland,504,51902,200106
and tackling staff shortages.,504,51902,200106
The SNP is determined to make significant progress by delivering real investment in our first term.,504,51902,200106
"Over the next twenty-five years, the NHS will spend nearly £3 billion under PFI contracts,",504,51902,200106
to service capital investment of only £ 1 billion.,504,51902,200106
"Through the STPI, we will lever in considerably more investment to NHS Scotland for the same or greater scale of commitment.",504,51902,200106
We will carry out an audit of the age and effectiveness of existing hospital equipment,504,51902,200106
and use the results of the audit to target capital investment to ensure that our hospitals are at the cutting edge of medical technology.,504,51902,200106
"The SNP will invest an extra £4 million in a ""Clean Hospitals Fund"" to enable an immediate clean up of Scotland’s hospitals.",504,51902,200106
"We will take action with the aim of employing at least 1,500 more nurses in the health service.",504,51902,200106
We will also launch a nurse recruitment campaign to encourage young people to enter the profession,504,51902,200106
and qualified nurses who have left it to return.,504,51902,200106
"With the investment that we are promising in hospital buildings,",504,51902,200106
medical equipment,504,51902,200106
"and nurses, we believe that maximum waiting times for all inpatient treatment can be cut by half in our first term in office.",504,51902,200106
The SNP are committed to free personal care for all elderly people who need it.,504,51902,200106
The SNP remains committed to paying personal care costs in full and,504,51902,200106
will do so on taking office if Labour continues to let Scotland’s pensioners down.,504,51902,200106
The SNP stands for Scotland in Europe.,108,51902,200106
The Scottish National Party believes that membership of the European Union will give Scotland real advantages.,108,51902,200106
"It will secure for Scotland a voice at the heart of Europe, with full membership of the important decision and policy-making bodies.",108,51902,200106
"We support the present confederal union in Europe,",108,51902,200106
and reject moves to a European ‘Super State’.,110,51902,200106
"We support steps towards enhanced co-operation in defence,",108,51902,200106
"foreign affairs,",108,51902,200106
trade and,108,51902,200106
"the environment,",108,51902,200106
"but reject abandoning national vetoes on issues relating to natural resources,",110,51902,200106
taxation and,110,51902,200106
the constitution.,110,51902,200106
"We seek a stronger commitment to subsidiarity, with responsibilities returned to member states in areas such as coastal fisheries under the Common Fisheries Policy.",703,51902,200106
Sharing of sovereignty should be restricted to defined areas where it brings clear benefits.,108,51902,200106
"We see advantages in Scottish membership of the single currency,",108,51902,200106
"but this can only be achieved when the economic conditions are correct,",110,51902,200106
when an acceptable exchange rate is delivered,110,51902,200106
and where public consent has been given in a referendum.,202,51902,200106
The SNP welcomes an enlarged Union.,108,51902,200106
This will give greater weight and prominence to small and medium sized nations.,108,51902,200106
"Clearly, after Nice, Scotland will have significantly greater influence in the European Union as an independent nation than as part of the United Kingdom.",108,51902,200106
"At present, Scotland is represented only in the European Parliament -",108,51902,200106
"but as part of the UK, we have only half as many MEPs as Denmark or Finland, countries with similar populations.",110,51902,200106
The Treaty of Nice would further reduce MEPs for Scotland within the UK -,110,51902,200106
but provide a better deal for Scotland with Independence.,202,51902,200106
An independent Scotland under the Nice Treaty would have its full quota of 13 MEPs,108,51902,200106
and seven weighted votes in the Council of,108,51902,200106
Ministers plus a member of the European Commission,108,51902,200106
- compared to no votes and no Commissioner within the UK.,301,51902,200106
On Independence we will negotiate the safe removal of Trident from Scotland,105,51902,200106
and an independent Scotland,301,51902,200106
"will work to eliminate nuclear,",105,51902,200106
biological,105,51902,200106
and chemical weapons world-wide.,105,51902,200106
Pre-independence we will continue to be part of the coalition against Trident in the UK.,105,51902,200106
"But while we have the risk of Trident, we should get the benefit of the jobs at Rosyth,",408,51902,200106
and we will fight any government proposals to remove refitting work from Scotland.,408,51902,200106
SNP MPs will oppose any involvement in a possible US National Missile Defence Programme,105,51902,200106
believing it to be unwise and damaging to international relations between east and west.,107,51902,200106
The SNP stands for co-operation in conventional defence.,104,51902,200106
"We will contribute to international security,",104,51902,200106
"conflict resolution,",106,51902,200106
peacekeeping,106,51902,200106
and disaster,107,51902,200106
"and humanitarian relief through the European Union Common Foreign & Security Policy and European Rapid Reaction Force,",107,51902,200106
"the OSCE, EAPC/PfP and the UN.",107,51902,200106
An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO.,104,51902,200106
However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult.,105,51902,200106
We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO,105,51902,200106
but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations through a variety of international involvements.,107,51902,200106
"An SNP government will promote the study of the theory and practice of peacekeeping,",106,51902,200106
and will make its skills available to Scottish Defence Force personnel,106,51902,200106
and to the forces of,107,51902,200106
democratically governed nations.,202,51902,200106
"The priority of the Scottish Defence Force (SDF), in partnership with Scotland's neighbours, will be to safeguard the land, sea and air space of Scotland.",104,51902,200106
"SDF training and equipment will reflect that,",104,51902,200106
as well as the need for rapid deployment overseas.,103,51902,200106
Some units will have specialised training for humanitarian and disaster relief operations.,107,51902,200106
The SDF will initially be equipped with Scotland's negotiated share of UK defence resources.,104,51902,200106
"Service and pension conditions will be equal to those of the UK forces, with some enhancements.",104,51902,200106
The SDF will be an all-professional force supported by part time volunteers,104,51902,200106
and jobs will be open to all who meet the appropriate standards.,701,51902,200106
All MoD civilians working in Scotland at Independence will be able to remain in the Scottish MoD or Scottish civil service.,704,51902,200106
"Defence industries will be subject to end user scrutiny to ensure that Scotland only exports arms to legitimate sources,",105,51902,200106
and not through third parties to the worst regimes.,105,51902,200106
While Scotland is in the UK the SNP will work to ensure that Scotland obtains a fair share of defence expenditure.,503,51902,200106
"Bases at Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Prestwick, Faslane and all barracks and training areas (regular and reserve) will be fully utilised by the SDF",104,51902,200106
and consideration may be given to using regular and reserve sites that have been shut by the UK.,104,51902,200106
Additional accommodation for specialised equipment or personnel may be built on any of the above sites.,104,51902,200106
An Independent Scotland will,301,51902,200106
"play a full role in the international community through its membership of the European Union,",108,51902,200106
the Commonwealth,107,51902,200106
and the United Nations.,107,51902,200106
"We will always promote Scottish interests internationally,",109,51902,200106
ensuring productive and harmonious relationships with the other countries of the world.,107,51902,200106
"Where UK embassies are about status, Scottish Embassies would be about business.",401,51902,200106
"The SNP would establish a commercially focussed presence for Scotland in the major commercial and population centres of the world by amalgamating the foreign representation of Locate in Scotland, Scottish Trade International and VisitScotland into External Affairs Offices of the Government of Scotland.",107,51902,200106
Scotland’s External Affairs department would operate on a budget no greater than the current spending by the Scottish Executive and its Agencies on overseas representation and our population share of Foreign & Commonwealth Office spending.,107,51902,200106
The SNP has a long-standing commitment to raise Scotland’s international aid budget to UN recommended levels.,107,51902,200106
"We are committed to the cancellation of Third World Debt and poverty eradication,",107,51902,200106
and accept the 2015 International Development Targets.,107,51902,200106
We would seek to reduce Third World debt by pushing for reform of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to allow for speedier and wider reaching relief to all countries that are in need.,107,51902,200106
International Aid will be in the form of grants or very low interest loans to avoid increasing the debt burden.,107,51902,200106
"The SNP does not believe in ""Aid for Trade"" and would accordingly untie all its aid programmes so that they would not be reliant on buying from Scottish firms, since this may not be appropriate for the recipient country.",107,51902,200106
"An SNP government will establish and fund a voluntary secretariat - ""Aid from Scotland"" -",107,51902,200106
"to coordinate a unified approach and provide a single point of contact for Scotland's aid agencies,",107,51902,200106
ensuring a quick response to global emergencies.,107,51902,200106
The SNP has consistently argued for legislative oversight of Scottish broadcasting to be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.,301,51902,200106
"The SNP is keen to see a ""dash for digital"" so that the changeover can establish Scotland's place in the forefront of technological development",411,51902,200106
and we believe the government must work in partnership with providers to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital revolution.,411,51902,200106
"The SNP anticipates a growing together of broadcasting, computer and mobile technology",411,51902,200106
and will support and assist those entrepreneurs who seek to make such technologies benefit our nation and the world.,411,51902,200106
"We will seek a presence in the UK,",301,51902,200106
European,301,51902,200106
"and global media,",301,51902,200106
to continue to campaign for the progressive devolution of powers over budget and,301,51902,200106
"schedule to BBC Scotland, and to argue for the Scottish Six.",301,51902,200106
"While realistic about the inevitability of change in the rules on cross media ownership, we will continue to seek a strong Scottish presence in worldwide and democratic markets.",601,51902,200106
"We see an important role for sport,",502,51902,200106
"not only in tackling issues relating to youth crime,",605,51902,200106
but also in ensuring improved health for people in Scotland.,504,51902,200106
The SNP would like to see resources currently available for sport focused more on local and community sporting activities.,301,51902,200106
"The SNP supports the creation of Football Academies,",502,51902,200106
and would use existing funds to assist in the creation of a national network of such bodies.,502,51902,200106
We will bid for the 2008 European Football Championships to be based in Scotland.,502,51902,200106
"The SNP will radically reform the Scottish Arts Council,",502,51902,200106
first of all by providing direct funding to the National companies,502,51902,200106
(including a new national theatre).,502,51902,200106
"From existing resources, we will establish a ""Scottish Academy"" to encourage excellence and to bring forward new talent",502,51902,200106
and we will considerably increase funding for traditional Scottish arts.,601,51902,200106
We will introduce a Scottish Lottery to provide money for good causes including the arts.,502,51902,200106
The SNP continues to campaign for secure status for Gaelic as one of the key measures that will assist in supporting and reviving the language.,607,51902,200106
We must put in place measures that stop the decline in the number of Gaelic speakers,607,51902,200106
and create a new generation of Gaelic speakers.,607,51902,200106
This means not only a much wider provision of Gaelic medium education,607,51902,200106
"but also the development of new opportunities for adults to become fluent Gaelic speakers,",607,51902,200106
and new ways of accessing such opportunities.,607,51902,200106
"The SNP would support measures to improve the teaching of Scots language and literature in schools,",607,51902,200106
and would encourage all forms of the media in positive promotion and usage of the language.,607,51902,200106
"Until Independence,",301,51902,200106
the SNP will keep up the pressure on the UK Government to fulfil their obligations to the Scots Language,607,51902,200106
under Part II of the European Charter,108,51902,200106
"for Regional and Minority Languages,",705,51902,200106
and seek specification under Part III.,607,51902,200106
In government we will ensure these obligations are fulfilled.,607,51902,200106
"The SNP is committed to a National Anti-Poverty Strategy,",504,51902,200106
"the aim of which is the eradication of structural poverty,",504,51902,200106
"both social and economic,",504,51902,200106
"as an integral element in the development of an economically dynamic and socially just Scotland with work,",504,51902,200106
education,506,51902,200106
and good health for all.,504,51902,200106
"The SNP would also promote ""poverty proofing"" -a process whereby agencies at all levels assess policies and programmes in relation to the likely impact they will have on poverty with a view to poverty reduction –",504,51902,200106
with specific and quantifiable targets the outcomes will be meaningful and achievable.,504,51902,200106
We would transfer the bureaucracy budget of Social Inclusion Partnerships to front line services particularly voluntary organisations dealing with poverty.,606,51902,200106
"The SNP abhors the current treatment of asylum seekers,",201,51902,200106
"in particular the voucher system,",201,51902,200106
which causes unnecessary hardship for many asylum-seeking families.,705,51902,200106
We also condemn the rhetoric of too many London politicians towards asylum seekers.,201,51902,200106
We would seek fast and fair assessment.,503,51902,200106
"The SNP will argue for the UK government to take immediate responsibility for the housing debt accrued by Scottish local authorities as a result of decades of Westminster rule,",414,51902,200106
and as has been done for the privatised water industry in England and Wales .,414,51902,200106
"This would relieve the burden of debt servicing from councils,",414,51902,200106
to free up cash for investment in Scotland’s housing.,504,51902,200106
Until Independence,301,51902,200106
our team of MPs will press for control over housing benefit to be devolved to the Scottish,301,51902,200106
Parliament so that we can use it as a lever to drive down rents,504,51902,200106
and increase family incomes.,603,51902,200106
We will use the Scottish Trust for Public Investment and the variety of other means available to government to lever in desperately needed investment into housing to do this.,504,51902,200106
We are against wholesale stock transfer of council housing stock.,411,51902,200106
We support smallscale community transfers,411,51902,200106
where the tenants and,706,51902,200106
local communities want it.,301,51902,200106
We would promote housing legislation to cover all tenures.,504,51902,200106
"The policy in the rented sector would be based on the principle of ‘Tenants First, Tenure Second’.",504,51902,200106
"We believe in level playing fields for housing providers and choice for rent and purchase, which is sustainable.",416,51902,200106
"We will end challenge funding schemes for voluntary organisations, which waste thousands of pounds in preparing unsuccessful bids.",606,51902,200106
We recognise that voluntary organisations require core funding and will consult on methods of funding distribution.,606,51902,200106
This will include three-year core funding arrangements.,606,51902,200106
We will review the existing Voluntary Compact and alleviate concerns that a two-tier voluntary sector has been created.,606,51902,200106
"We will review the taxation regime for voluntary organisations,",606,51902,200106
and will exempt voluntary organisations from water charges.,606,51902,200106
Homelessness has reached record levels under New Labour.,705,51902,200106
"We will work to ensure effective delivery of services to end rough sleeping,",705,51902,200106
tackling the many issues which affect people forced to sleep rough.,705,51902,200106
We will also tackle ‘hidden homelessness’ by providing homes and the support needed.,504,51902,200106
"The SNP has a long held commitment to a constitutionally enshrined guarantee of equal opportunities for all Scots regardless of race,",503,51902,200106
"gender,",503,51902,200106
"age,",503,51902,200106
"Sexuality,",503,51902,200106
disability,503,51902,200106
or social background.,503,51902,200106
We will continue to place this commitment at the centre of our actions both in the House of Commons and in the Scottish Parliament.,503,51902,200106
"Until Independence,",301,51902,200106
"we will press for legislative powers in this area to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament,",301,51902,200106
as it has been to the Northern Ireland Assembly.,301,51902,200106
Disabled people still face barriers of discrimination in many areas of life.,503,51902,200106
"Everyone should be given equality of opportunity to fulfil their potential,",503,51902,200106
"no matter who they are,",503,51902,200106
or how able they are.,503,51902,200106
No disabled person should be socially excluded,503,51902,200106
or find themselves in poverty because of their disability.,503,51902,200106
"Government has a responsibility to lead the way in ending discrimination against disabled people,",503,51902,200106
challenging attitudes,503,51902,200106
and ensuring that every area of legislation promotes equality of opportunity for disabled people within our society.,503,51902,200106
"As a first step, we will extend the powers and scope of the Disability Discrimination Act",503,51902,200106
and introduce a disability equality indicator.,503,51902,200106
Government must do more to identify dealers and bring them to justice;,605,51902,200106
more to provide focused and relevant education about the dangers of drugs;,603,51902,200106
and more to assist drug misusers with rehabilitation and support.,706,51902,200106
We recognise the need to support families of those misusing drugs,603,51902,200106
and to develop routes out of drug taking for communities affected by the growth in drug abuse.,706,51902,200106
"Our additional resources for Scotland’s police forces,",605,51902,200106
"and the fast-tracking and treatment of drug misusers through Drugs Courts, will allow us to focus more on key elements of the drugs problem in our country.",605,51902,200106
The SNP will increase police resources to tackle crime,605,51902,200106
as well as recognising the rights and responsibilities of citizens in tackling crime.,605,51902,200106
The police are our front line against crime.,605,51902,200106
"Public perception is of declining police numbers,",605,51902,200106
a lessening of visible presence on the streets,605,51902,200106
and less security in our homes and communities.,605,51902,200106
"It is in recognition of the vital role played by our police that the SNP intends to make available a sum of £25 million specifically to provide 1,000 new officers in Scotland,",605,51902,200106
over and above the existing provision.,605,51902,200106
Every part of Scotland would benefit,605,51902,200106
and there would also be a welcome change in public perception and,605,51902,200106
an increase in public confidence that our streets were truly becoming safer.,605,51902,200106
It is the right of every individual in society to live safely and securely;,605,51902,200106
to have their privacy respected;,201,51902,200106
and to expect that their property and homes will be secure against criminal activity.,605,51902,200106
"However, the right of each individual is balanced by an equivalent responsibility not to behave in ways that deprive others of their rights.",201,51902,200106
We will introduce measures to tackle youth offending because those who begin to are young are likely to continue offending in later life.,605,51902,200106
The SNP believes that it is not just the responsibility of the education system to teach good citizenship -,506,51902,200106
first and foremost it is a job for parents who have primary responsibility for their children.,603,51902,200106
The SNP will consider a further extension of the existing legal responsibility of parents for the actions of their children.,603,51902,200106
"While it would not be appropriate to charge parents and take them through the criminal courts for actions committed by their offspring, it is nevertheless our view that it should be possible to institute a form of Compensation Order on parents",603,51902,200106
when the activities of their child have resulted in physical damage to property or tangible upset to a victim.,605,51902,200106
Any provision for such Orders would have to allow both for judicial discretion in imposing them,605,51902,200106
and the ability to take the financial circumstances of the parent/s into account.,603,51902,200106
"Nevertheless, the impact on the victim, who is otherwise left with the financial responsibility for a repair that is no fault of theirs, cannot be ignored.",706,51902,200106
The SNP believes that our criminal justice system should provide for a form of life-time supervision for those offenders for whom it was considered there would never be a point when they were regarded as no longer being a danger.,605,51902,200106
The SNP would move to implement the Maclean Report on Serious Violent & Sexual Offenders - in particular the recommendation for an Order for Lifelong Restriction for high-risk sex offenders.,605,51902,200106
This would ensure constant monitoring,605,51902,200106
and a recall to custody if the Order were breached.,605,51902,200106
We would provide for Supervised Release Orders to be available to the Courts even in Summary Cases.,605,51902,200106
"The SNP would ensure that the position is changed to provide that where a victim is over the age of 18, the offender would still be liable to have their name entered onto the Register.",605,51902,200106
There are other key areas where the SNP will take action.,605,51902,200106
We will set up a Sentencing Advisory Panel;,605,51902,200106
speed up the process of criminal cases in the lower courts which would be of benefit to both the accused and to victims;,605,51902,200106
and tackle once and for all the status of those who are deported to Scotland from other countries after having served sentences for very serious offences.,605,51902,200106
"The SNP at Westminster will also argue very strongly that as long as the current devolved arrangements prevail, Scotland should continue to get increases in money earmarked for justice initiatives",605,51902,200106
equivalent to those available in England and Wales.,503,51902,200106
"As part of this process we will continue to argue that the proportion of Fixed Penalty money and fine money, which at present is deposited with HM Treasury, is retained for use in Scotland",605,51902,200106
and reinvested in our criminal justice system.,605,51902,200106
No one in Scotland today knows how much they pay to the Government in taxation.,303,51902,200106
Under Labour the tax system has become increasingly complex.,303,51902,200106
The imposition of more and more stealth taxes has broken the democratic link between the government that sets and spends taxes and the people that pay them.,202,51902,200106
Complex taxation is inefficient,303,51902,200106
as well as undemocratic.,202,51902,200106
Labour have more than doubled the number of tax rates since they took power.,414,51902,200106
"On top of that there are more than 250 complex tax allowances, credits and disregards.",303,51902,200106
The overall cost of administering the UK’s tax system is estimated by the Inland Revenue at 1.1 p for every £1 collected in tax.,303,51902,200106
In Ireland the cost is 0. 88p.,303,51902,200106
Reducing the cost of collection to the Irish level would save £90 million next year alone,414,51902,200106
- money that could be invested in public services.,504,51902,200106
Labour like the Tories have increased the share of tax that is levied indirectly and,414,51902,200106
takes no account of peoplé s ability to pay.,701,51902,200106
We want to tackle all of these problems with practical solutions.,303,51902,200106
It is not acceptable for political parties to mislead the people about taxation in elections.,202,51902,200106
We pledge to bring honesty and clarity to the debate with a series of proposals on taxation based on the following principles:,303,51902,200106
1 We will not introduce any new measures to increase the overall burden of taxation,414,51902,200106
or increase the rate of income tax without consulting the people first through our manifesto.,202,51902,200106
"2 We will undertake a Comprehensive Review of Taxation (CRT) to deliver fairness, simplicity, transparency and honesty in the taxation system.",303,51902,200106
The CRT will have a remit to produce reform proposals that taken together do not increase the overall burden of taxation.,414,51902,200106
One of our key aims in this review will be to cut business taxation.,402,51902,200106
Moreover we will not implement the full proposals of the CRT without putting them to the people in our next manifesto.,202,51902,200106
All our taxation policies will be informed by these core principles and for this election we offer the following specific proposals.,303,51902,200106
In advance of the CRT we propose one initial measure to fulfil our commitments to drive fuel prices down,414,51902,200106
and to shift the burden of taxation from unfair stealth taxation to honest fair taxation.,503,51902,200106
We believe that both these commitments require honest policy decisions now so in advance of the CRT we will cut taxation on fuel by 10p a gallon (including VAT).,414,51902,200106
This cut in taxation will cost £65m,414,51902,200106
"and will be paid for by introducing an extra 5p band of income taxation for those with taxable earnings over £ 100,000 per year (affecting only ten thousand of the wealthiest Scots) .",503,51902,200106
The Treasury estimates that this will raise £80 million paying easily for the fuel tax cut .,414,51902,200106
Any surplus in in revenues from this measure will be directed towards further reductions in duty as part of the process of achieving our target of bringing fuel prices into line with our competitors in Europe.,414,51902,200106
Taken together therefore these two measures are redistributive and will be revenue neutral.,503,51902,200106
The SNP will stand up for local government,301,51902,200106
and for proper long term funding of council services.,301,51902,200106
"In particular, we support a comprehensive review of local government finance",301,51902,200106
including investigation of a local income tax to replace the current council tax.,301,51902,200106
We recognise the need to adequately reward staff,704,51902,200106
and will work with local authorities,301,51902,200106
and trades unions,701,51902,200106
to improve conditions for public sector workers.,704,51902,200106
We stand for the right of local government to subsidiarity and,301,51902,200106
the continued direct delivery of public services.,504,51902,200106
We support proportional representation,202,51902,200106
and the introduction of single transferable voting to elect councillors.,202,51902,200106
"The foot-and-mouth disease brought into sharp focus the great difficulties which businesses face in rural Scotland,",703,51902,200106
and how vulnerable they are.,703,51902,200106
"Even before the outbreak began, rural Scotland faced economic problems.",703,51902,200106
"Rural Scotland now faces economic problems on an unprecedented scale,",703,51902,200106
as a result of a series of disastrous policies pursued by successive London governments.,703,51902,200106
"The SNP supports the following policy measures, with the aim of providing a level playing field for the rural economy.",703,51902,200106
Small businesses are the bedrock of the rural economy.,402,51902,200106
We will address each of the barriers to growth and,410,51902,200106
success of small business.,402,51902,200106
"We will use our tax review to consider proposals for a small business rates relief scheme,",402,51902,200106
which will seek to end the unfair burden which business rates pose for our small business.,403,51902,200106
The rural economy could be boosted by the promotion of information,402,51902,200106
and communication technology based businesses and teleworking.,411,51902,200106
This potential has not yet been realised.,411,51902,200106
"We support an immediate cut in excise duty on fuel of 10 pence per gallon,",402,51902,200106
and in the longer term will aim to reduce the burden of fuel tax to European average levels.,402,51902,200106
The burden of fuel costs is particularly high for rural communities,402,51902,200106
and we will use government power and influence to end the outrage of substantially higher prices in the Highlands and Islands.,402,51902,200106
We will seek to direct more resources and effort in improving rural public transport,703,51902,200106
and the rural transport infrastructure.,703,51902,200106
Government’s role should be to reduce the unnecessary barriers and burdens facing rural producers.,703,51902,200106
"We will work to free up available euro cash, like agrimonetary compensation and support for scallop farmers.",703,51902,200106
"The SNP is determined to ensure that key services such as rural sub post offices,",703,51902,200106
rural schools,703,51902,200106
and rural transport links remain at the heart of rural Scotland.,703,51902,200106
An SNP government will ensure contingency funds are used to compensate business affected by the current crisis,402,51902,200106
and are available for use in the event of future crises in the rural economy.,703,51902,200106
The foot-and-mouth crisis across the UK has served to confirm the fragility of agriculture and its related industries and,703,51902,200106
also the sector’s importance to Scotland.,703,51902,200106
There will need to be a comprehensive review of agricultural strategy once the current foot and mouth disease has been controlled.,703,51902,200106
That review will need to look very carefully at many issues of concern.,703,51902,200106
"These include procedures of entry into our ports,",703,51902,200106
"laxity of import controls on meat,",703,51902,200106
"mandatory country of origin labelling,",703,51902,200106
use of food remains and,703,51902,200106
the role of locally based abattoirs and processing plants.,703,51902,200106
"Until we get Independence,",301,51902,200106
"the SNP is determined to see Scottish ministers have a more direct involvement in European decision making,",108,51902,200106
and will continue to press for a direct and distinct voice for Scottish ministers at European Council meetings.,301,51902,200106
The SNP is determined to ensure a level playing field for our farmers in Europe.,703,51902,200106
Where the UK government has allowed competitive disadvantage for key sectors by the early and fullest implementation of European rules,110,51902,200106
", the SNP in government will only seek to introduce into domestic law European regulations when they have been adopted and applied in full by a majority of European nations.",203,51902,200106
"This will ensure that our farmers are not forced to operate under more restrictive and more expensive rules than farmers elsewhere within the EU,",703,51902,200106
and will therefore be more able to compete fairly in European markets.,703,51902,200106
"With the SNP in government, agriculture policy will be developed in the interests of Scotland’s farming community",703,51902,200106
"and in response to specific Scottish circumstances,",703,51902,200106
rather than as a follow on to events elsewhere in the UK.,301,51902,200106
"This strategy will extend into the rural economy,",703,51902,200106
"with resources focused on diversification of efforts,",703,51902,200106
promotion of specialised agriculture -,703,51902,200106
such as free-range herds,703,51902,200106
"and organic produce,",703,51902,200106
where Scotland already has a natural advantage,703,51902,200106
– and with specific efforts to promote the export of quality Scottish produce.,703,51902,200106
The SNP believes the Less Favoured Areas deal will cause financial hardship for many farmers and,703,51902,200106
crofters and must be ameliorated.,703,51902,200106
"This should be done by the Scottish Executive using funds from other sources, such as modulation,",703,51902,200106
and by a comprehensive renegotiation of the original deal.,703,51902,200106
Recent events have demonstrated clearly why the voice of the fishing communities must be heard.,703,51902,200106
The SNP favours compensated tie-up schemes as an essential component of government aid packages.,703,51902,200106
"This would allow the fishing fleet to remain viable,",703,51902,200106
"protect juvenile stocks,",501,51902,200106
and protect the long-term future of the Scottish white fish fleet.,703,51902,200106
"Working with the industry, we will promote the introduction of technical conservation measures",703,51902,200106
that will ensure our coastal communities are able to benefit from sustainable fisheries.,416,51902,200106
At Westminster we will continue to seek designation of Scottish fisheries ministers as the UK lead in Europe,703,51902,200106
and will demand the return of the 6000 square miles of fishing grounds removed from Scottish jurisdiction by the government in London.,301,51902,200106
"While ensuring the Common Fisheries Policy guarantees Scotland’s historic fishing rights, the SNP will seek its reform to include as a main principle the decentralisation of fisheries management through the establishment of Zonal Fisheries Management Councils.",301,51902,200106
"We will support the fish processing industry to ensure its continued competitiveness,",703,51902,200106
and assist Scotland’s aquaculture sector to become a world leader.,703,51902,200106
"In addition, we will pursue a level playing field for the industry,",703,51902,200106
to ensure that our fishermen and fish processors do not face additional cost,703,51902,200106
and regulatory burdens as compared to our closest competitors.,703,51902,200106
"We will instruct a wide ranging and independent inquiry into fish farming in Scotland,",703,51902,200106
"following which we would seek to frame a long term strategy for the future of salmon farming,",703,51902,200106
"with particular regard to the need for Scotland to be competitive in relation to Ireland,",703,51902,200106
"Norway and other salmon farming countries,",703,51902,200106
and the securing of effective regulation of the industry,501,51902,200106
and the safeguarding of the environment.,703,51902,200106
"We would ensure that SEPA has the resources to carry out their tasks, by ending the payment of rent to the Crown Estate Commission.",703,51902,200106
The SNP has long been at the forefront of the campaign to modernise Scotland’s land laws,301,51902,200106
"and to give communities increased say, control and involvement in the land.",301,51902,200106
We will continue to press for control of the Scottish Land Fund to be transferred from the London based trustees of the New Opportunities Fund to the Scottish Parliament.,301,51902,200106
"We support community right to buy,",301,51902,200106
but believe that more effective mechanisms must also be put in place to ensure greater involvement for communities who want to participate in decision-making in relation to their land,301,51902,200106
but want to stop short of ownership.,301,51902,200106
We will work with anglers and local communities,301,51902,200106
"to create a national freshwater fisheries policy that will ensure access,",703,51902,200106
maximise economic benefit for our rural economy,703,51902,200106
and ensure the protection of the environment.,501,51902,200106
We stand for restoring the link between the basic state pension and average earnings.,504,51902,200106
"We will press for the link to be restored at a UK level,",504,51902,200106
"and with Independence,",301,51902,200106
will restore the link for Scotland’s pensioners each year for the term of the next Parliament.,504,51902,200106
This would mean that by the end of the next parliament pensioners could gain up to £200 a year in addition to Labour’s plans.,504,51902,200106
We will pay for this by utilising the surplus in the National Insurance Fund that has been created by the existing generation of pensioners.,504,51902,200106
"An SNP government will examine proposals that will ensure pensioners who have small occupational pensions,",504,51902,200106
or who are near the current threshold of income for taxation are not penalised by the tax treatment of these increases in the basic state pension.,504,51902,200106
As part of this we will examine proposals to allow a Scottish government to remove the distortions and inequities caused by the differentials between the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and the basic state pension,503,51902,200106
-a means testing that discriminates against too many on low incomes who have saved for their old age.,504,51902,200106
It is our aim to work to equalise the basic state pension and,503,51902,200106
the level of the MIG as resources become available.,504,51902,200106
The SNP continues to support the payment of a cold climate allowance - paid to pensioners throughout the winter months.,504,51902,200106
"As a first step to achieving this aim, we will on a weekly basis spread payments of the current winter fuel assistance over the winter months.",504,51902,200106
An SNP government will examine the level of bureaucracy within the social security system.,303,51902,200106
This will take three forms.,303,51902,200106
Firstly we will examine the structure for social security delivery.,303,51902,200106
"Where as the UK has the bureaucracy and waste of three separate social security agencies, / the SNP will investigate the creation of a single agency responsible for the streamlining of benefit payments at all levels in Scotland.",504,51902,200106
Secondly we will examine the actual delivery of key benefits to minimise bureaucracy and cost.,303,51902,200106
"For example, we will undertake a review of housing benefit.",303,51902,200106
It is our belief that the rules can be simplified,303,51902,200106
and the process of payment accelerated.,303,51902,200106
Our overall aim however is to re-direct housing benefit to drive down housing costs,504,51902,200106
and improve family incomes.,603,51902,200106
The core purpose of our review will be to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the system.,303,51902,200106
"Finally, we will examine the workings and effectiveness of each benefit,",303,51902,200106
with the aim of removing unnecessary barriers to uptake,504,51902,200106
and to increasing support to key groups.,504,51902,200106
We will streamline the application process,303,51902,200106
and review the tests and timescales to ensure those who are entitled to support get it quickly.,504,51902,200106
We will also consider proposals to review Welfare to Work beneficiary rules so that disabled people moving into work are not penalised financially.,705,51902,200106
We will also reform financial support for carers so the system reflects the value of and savings to the state that their caring provides to society.,504,51902,200106
It is our aim to extend the winter fuel allowance to severely disabled people under 60 as resources become available.,504,51902,200106
We will review overall financial support available to 16 and 17 year olds including targeted restoration of benefits as resources become available.,504,51902,200106
In general we support initiatives to help families from welfare to work.,603,51902,200106
"We will however examine the delivery of the Working Families Tax Credit,",603,51902,200106
which can lead to prohibitive levels of marginal taxation sometimes up to 96% as people lose out on other benefits e.g. housing benefit.,603,51902,200106
"Because it is a benefit that has to be applied for, we would also examine concerns over the take up rate for Working Families Tax Credit,",603,51902,200106
discrepancies in how some employers can abuse the system,605,51902,200106
and examine options to ensure that more families access the money available.,603,51902,200106
We support the provision of information and advice as an essential part of benefit take up campaigns.,504,51902,200106

"An efficient and effective transport network is the key to Scotland’s success, socially and economically.",411,51902,200106
We recognise that it is the job of government to provide the delivery framework,411,51902,200106
and the focus to help people and goods get to where they want to go.,411,51902,200106
An SNP government would set out the overall strategy and frameworks.,411,51902,200106
Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) will be publicly accountable,202,51902,200106
and will be responsible for the delivery of regional transport solutions.,303,51902,200106
We will introduce a single safety authority for all forms of transport.,411,51902,200106
Air safety is paramount and Air Traffic Control will remain under public sector control.,412,51902,200106
Initially we would take shares for subsidy to create a ‘public sharé of Railtrack to guarantee a level of public accountability,202,51902,200106
without ruling out the possibility of public ownership.,413,51902,200106
We would reconnect communities,411,51902,200106
and re-open key strategic lines including direct rail links with airports.,411,51902,200106
We would develop a strategy to systematically deal with the electrification of key rail lines.,411,51902,200106

to fill gaps of roads unfinished by previous Labour and Tory administrations.,411,51902,200106

The SNP is committed to bringing forward proposals for the reduction in ferry fares in Scotland as part of a process towards the piloting and evaluation of Road Equivalent Tariffs.,411,51902,200106
Academic research has suggested that lower ferry fares could be introduced on a cost neutral basis.,411,51902,200106
Equal treatment for island communities will be at the core of decision making in an SNP government.,503,51902,200106
"We would promote freight and passenger ‘hub’ airports in Scotland,",411,51902,200106
and conduct a Scottish airports review aimed at increasing direct flights from Scotland to Europe and,411,51902,200106
"placing downward pressure on fare prices and landing charges,",411,51902,200106
with a particular focus on the large supplement fares paid by Scottish consumers for holiday charter flights.,411,51902,200106

To create a truly democratic central and local government,202,51110,201505

"in our common humanity,",606,51110,201505

and in our capacity to govern ourselves.,606,51110,201505
"Imagine a government that believes in the common good,",606,51110,201505
"and that the best way of achieving it is by working for each other, rather than against each other.",606,51110,201505
Imagine honest government.,304,51110,201505
That’s the world the Green Party wants to make real.,606,51110,201505
It’s also the world that most of us want.,606,51110,201505
"When asked to vote for policies rather than parties or personalities, Green policies consistently come out on top.",501,51110,201505
And it’s so different from what we have now.,305,51110,201505
"In consumer societies like ours, the common good has been forgotten.",606,51110,201505
"So much government has been outsourced, put out to tender.",606,51110,201505
The reins have been handed over to the unfettered market and big corporations.,403,51110,201505
"They are given as the reason why we can’t do things (such as bring the railways back into public ownership),",413,51110,201505
why we must do things (lower taxes for the rich),503,51110,201505
and how we must do things (privatise public utilities).,413,51110,201505
"When government has been active it’s been to make the rich richer and the poor poorer,",503,51110,201505
while blocking action to prevent ecological catastrophe.,501,51110,201505
This has had disastrous consequences for the common good and for the protection of the natural world.,501,51110,201505
"Back in the 1970s a determined assault on public life began, and the market became the model and measure of life.",416,51110,201505
"Since then, successive governments of all colours have found ways to justify and deepen the role of the market in our lives.",416,51110,201505
"Local government? Check out your nearest website or leaflet: you’re likely to be referred to as a customer, not a citizen.",301,51110,201505
Privatisation? Look at one of the most recent – Royal Mail.,413,51110,201505
"This was owned by you and me, then it was sold for a song,",606,51110,201505
with windfall profits for companies doing the only job the market really understands – maximising shareholder profit.,403,51110,201505
"The public lost £1 billion, while George Osborne’s best man’s hedge fund pocketed £36 million.",304,51110,201505
Outsourcing? This is what governments do when they’ve given up governing.,304,51110,201505
"The result is a series of scandals from companies with increasingly infamous names – G4S, SERCO, ATOS – over which we have no control.",403,51110,201505
"Zero-hours contracts? These are designed for companies looking to maximise profits through labour flexibility, but hopeless if you have regular bills to pay.",701,51110,201505
The market has been in charge for so long that it dominates our imagination and colours our view of ourselves.,403,51110,201505
The market is short sighted and short term.,403,51110,201505
It’s time for change – time to put the market to work for the common good and for people to be put back in charge.,403,51110,201505
The Green Party knows that:,305,51110,201505
It’s hard to be a citizen when life tells you that you are a consumer;,606,51110,201505
It’s hard to think of others when we are pitted against one another and sold the lie that individuals are to blame for their misfortunes;,606,51110,201505
and It’s hard to think of the common good when it’s never mentioned.,606,51110,201505
Private interests have ruled the roost for far too long.,403,51110,201505
"The result is a society scarred by inequalities of power and wealth,",503,51110,201505
and a planet plundered of resources and damaged by pollution.,501,51110,201505
All in it together? We don’t think so.,606,51110,201505
Those with power and wealth have done very well out of austerity:,503,51110,201505
the UK’s wealthiest 1% grab more than anywhere else in Europe.,503,51110,201505
"Politics has fragmented, public institutions have weakened, people’s lives are dominated by insecurity, and prejudice is rife.",202,51110,201505
"We live in a price-tag society – and if you can’t pay the price, too bad.",503,51110,201505
Things that used to be done by public agencies have been outsourced.,413,51110,201505
Once it was a duty for all of us to look after the vulnerable when times were hard.,606,51110,201505
"We paid taxes into a common fund to look after the poor, the weak, the old and the sick, and to educate the young.",606,51110,201505
"This is what we did as citizens, bound together by what we share rather than separated by what divides us.",606,51110,201505
"Now care has been outsourced to charity, to food banks.",503,51110,201505
"Some think this is a sign of the Big Society, but we think it’s the sign of a failed society.",503,51110,201505
Individual charity is no substitute for collective justice.,503,51110,201505
For 40 years the rich and powerful have forced us to live in their fantasy world – a world that suits the minority not the majority.,503,51110,201505
"This is a world imagined from the point of view of the healthy, the wealthy and the privileged.",503,51110,201505
"Where there is a satisfying job just round the corner if only we could be bothered to look for it,",503,51110,201505
"where resources are limitless,",503,51110,201505
and where the only obstacle to total fulfilment is the psychology of individual failure.,503,51110,201505
"Meanwhile, in the real world where most of us live, we are young and old, sometimes poor and sick, jobs are scarce,",503,51110,201505
"the Earth groans under the weight of our demands,",501,51110,201505
and the obstacles in the way of our flourishing can be stubborn and unyielding.,503,51110,201505
How should we organise life in this real world?,503,51110,201505
Do we want our security to depend on the underpaid zero-hours worker,701,51110,201505
"of an outsourced company, maximising shareholder profit?",403,51110,201505
"No, we want well-trained, committed workers, properly paid and secure in their own lives",701,51110,201505
– because our well-being is linked to everyone else’s.,606,51110,201505
Do we want a world in which privatisation is the solution for everything?,413,51110,201505
"Or have we learnt from energy, water and rail that down that road lies private gain rather than the common good?",413,51110,201505
It’s public ownership and democratic control that lead to fairer services and better outcomes.,413,51110,201505
"The market makes us impatient with the suffering of others, tolerant of inequality, prone to prejudice, suspicious of difference.",403,51110,201505
"We know we can be cooperative, appreciative, understanding and fair.",606,51110,201505
We just need a world that encourages us to be these things.,107,51110,201505
Together we can create that world.,107,51110,201505
"The challenges that lie ahead of us are unique in their combination: declining resources,",701,51110,201505
"global warming,",701,51110,201505
"deepening inequality,",701,51110,201505
footloose capital.,416,51110,201505
"But these problems have been created by us, so they can be solved by us.",107,51110,201505
We need to remake society.,606,51110,201505
"And in this remaking we need finally to realise that consumer capitalism is the problem, not the solution.",416,51110,201505
The solution lies in a democratically managed economy,202,51110,201505
that operates within the Earth’s resource limits.,416,51110,201505
"We don’t want a privatised outsourced state, we want a green and democratic one.",202,51110,201505
"We want a public National Health Service, not privatised healthcare.",413,51110,201505
"The uncoordinated actions of millions of individuals, with unequal access to wealth and power and urged to maximise their own interests without regard for anyone else’s, will only deepen the crisis.",606,51110,201505
"This is what’s on offer from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, from Labour and from UKIP.",305,51110,201505
"We need a party prepared to challenge the damage this has done, a party that expects something better.",305,51110,201505
We need a party prepared for the real world.,305,51110,201505
We need a party for the common good.,606,51110,201505
We need the Green Party.,501,51110,201505
"Imagine having a secure, fulfilling and decently paid job, knowing that you are working to live and not living to work.",701,51110,201505
"Imagine coming home to an affordable flat or house, and being valued for your contribution and character, not for how much you earn.",503,51110,201505
Imagine knowing that you and your friends are part of an economy that works with the planet rather than against it.,416,51110,201505
Imagine food banks going out of business.,503,51110,201505
Imagine the end of poverty and deprivation.,503,51110,201505
The key to all this is to put the economy at the service of people and planet rather than the other way round.,501,51110,201505
That’s what the Green Party will do.,501,51110,201505
The main issue for many at this election is the economy.,408,51110,201505
Many people have very practical worries:,503,51110,201505
Is my job secure?,701,51110,201505
Will our family have enough this month to pay the bills and put food on the table?,503,51110,201505
Can we keep paying the mortgage or the rent?,503,51110,201505
Will we have to continue to work unreasonably long or unpredictable hours?,701,51110,201505
Is my pay fair compared with others?,701,51110,201505
Will my benefits be cut?,504,51110,201505
Will I ever get a pension?,504,51110,201505
Will I ever get a job with a future?,701,51110,201505
Will I ever pay off my student loan?,504,51110,201505
Will I ever find a decent place to live?,503,51110,201505
Will the economy provide a decent livelihood long into the future for our children and grandchildren?,503,51110,201505
Our solutions to these worries are very different from the other parties.,416,51110,201505
The Coalition parties and Labour agree on one thing about the economy: it’s got to grow because growth is the answer to everything.,416,51110,201505
"If the costs include ruining our climate and countryside by exploiting shale gas, tolerating massive inequality and the insecurity of zero-hours contracts or massive underemployment – then too bad.",416,51110,201505
We don’t agree with the growth objective.,416,51110,201505
"Our economic policy promotes a fair, just and more equal society",503,51110,201505
while recognising that we live on a finite planet.,501,51110,201505
It’s easy to forget the fact that everything we make and everything we buy comes from the Earth.,501,51110,201505
And we have only one of them.,501,51110,201505
"If everyone on Earth consumed at the rate we do in the UK, we’d need nearly three planets to sustain us.",416,51110,201505
"If it’s the average North American, then we’d need nearly four planets.",416,51110,201505
Greens are sometimes accused of being unrealistic about economics.,416,51110,201505
Nothing could be further from the truth.,416,51110,201505
"It’s our opponents who are the fantasists, believing that continual growth is possible on a finite planet",416,51110,201505
". Greens are the realists, understanding that the planet imposes limits and focusing on essentials such as jobs, housing and the household budget.",416,51110,201505
"The economy depends on society,",606,51110,201505
which depends on the Earth and its resources.,501,51110,201505
That’s the order of things – not the other way round.,501,51110,201505
"And what’s growth for, anyway?",416,51110,201505
"The aim of politics is to help us flourish, and by this measure growth has failed in recent decades.",416,51110,201505
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) tells us that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person has grown by more than three times since 1955, allowing for inflation.",416,51110,201505
Are we three or four times more content?,416,51110,201505
"No, levels of life satisfaction have dropped in this period.",416,51110,201505
We’re told that growth has returned to the UK.,416,51110,201505
The result? More than one in four children is growing up in poverty.,416,51110,201505
The bosses of the UK’s 100 biggest companies earn on average 143 times more than their staff.,416,51110,201505
The top 1% of the population has the same wealth as the bottom 55%.,503,51110,201505

Joining up the policies.,305,51110,201505
"Government is run too much by Departments, which rarely take any notice of each other.",303,51110,201505
Greens like to join things up...,305,51110,201505
"So what do social justice and greater equality have to do with health, education, opportunity, the numbers in prison, and even recycling?",503,51110,201505
This manifesto has many other policies designed to improve all these things.,503,51110,201505
But just making us more equal will improve all of them.,503,51110,201505
"So it’s not the economy, stupid.",416,51110,201505
Or at least not one that grows forever.,416,51110,201505
The Green Party believes that equality is much more important than growth.,416,51110,201505
And growth doesn’t bring equality; in fact it helps to justify inequality.,416,51110,201505
The result of the corrosive trickle-down fantasy is plain: the sixth-richest society in the world is disfigured by high levels of deprivation.,416,51110,201505
And it’s not only those right at the bottom who have problems.,416,51110,201505
"Despite the fact that household incomes are now back to 2007–08 levels, families on ordinary incomes have faced a real squeeze since 2009–10 as prices go up and incomes stagnate.",503,51110,201505
We will abandon GDP and the pursuit of growth as a measure of economic success.,416,51110,201505
"We would use a measure of Adjusted National Product (ANP), which would take account of capital and environmental depreciation and include the value of many things not currently paid for, such as unpaid work at home.",416,51110,201505
Green councillors mobilise alternatives to payday lenders...,305,51110,201505
"In a move to break people’s dependence on payday lenders, in Stowmarket, Suffolk, Councillor John Matthissen is leading a cross-agency project to launch a collection and information point for the local credit union.",403,51110,201505
"We make an important distinction between short-term growth, or ‘regeneration’, and long-term dependency on continuing economic growth.",409,51110,201505
"The measures we propose as alternatives to austerity will, by halting and reversing the cuts to public services, restore lost jobs and create new ones.",409,51110,201505
"The increased economic activity will cause the economy to grow rather than shrink in the short term, restoring employment and living standards.",409,51110,201505
"However, we see such short-term growth as transitional, as a side-effect of ending the failed austerity project.",409,51110,201505
We do not see it as a contradiction to adapting the economy for One-Planet Living in the longer term.,107,51110,201505
There is an alternative to austerity.,408,51110,201505
The crunch of 2008 was the result of the pressures of our consumer society and an unregulated finance system; people borrowed too much and banks were too willing to lend.,403,51110,201505
"Now people and businesses are paying down their debts, businesses contract haphazardly and workers are laid off.",403,51110,201505
"The Coalition’s reaction was to use this as an excuse to impose austerity – in order to cut the debt, especially the government’s deficit – while doing little to strengthen the economy.",410,51110,201505
"The winners are those who absorb corporate surpluses, the chief executives and the shareholders.",403,51110,201505
"The biggest losers are the unemployed, the low paid and the vulnerable, especially those who depend on public services.",403,51110,201505
Labour plans to match the Tories’ ‘fiscal envelope’ for Departmental spending – code for more austerity.,408,51110,201505
We think the economy should work for us all.,410,51110,201505
We want a One-Planet economy that will address the challenge of climate change and unacceptable levels of inequality.,107,51110,201505
We have to throw off the shackles of market ideology and consider afresh what really needs to be done.,403,51110,201505
We need to: Ensure that everyone who wants one has a decent secure job paid at least a living wage.,412,51110,201505

See the section on Finance in Chapter 9.,403,51110,201505
"Provide equality and security in a mixed economy by committing to the common good, a larger public sector and higher taxation, funding our health, education and local services properly, and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.",403,51110,201505
See the section on Taxes in Chapter 9.,403,51110,201505
Be prepared to borrow on good terms to fund investment rather than making closing the deficit the main objective of our economic policy.,409,51110,201505
The plans in this manifesto require borrowing of £338 billion (in real 2015 terms) over the Parliament as compared with the Coalition’s plan in the 2015 Budget to borrow £115 billion.,409,51110,201505
"If monetary policy demands quantitative easing, we will spend that money directly on green investment.",501,51110,201505
"However, the programme of public spending and taxation in this manifesto would show a surplus on the current account (that is, excluding investment) of 2.7% by the end of the Parliament.",408,51110,201505
Reject the dogma that everything is best done by the private sector.,403,51110,201505

See Chapter 13 on International Affairs.,107,51110,201505
Ensure that the Treasury’s priority objective is to deliver an economy with these aims.,107,51110,201505

The third planet from the sun.,501,51110,201505
Our home.,501,51110,201505
Home to 9 million other species.,501,51110,201505
The only planet with liquid water at its surface.,501,51110,201505
The only planet in the solar system with 21% oxygen.,501,51110,201505
"As far as we know, the only planet in the solar system that sustains life.",501,51110,201505
"Imagine a political party that prioritises the protection of the land, the seas and their inhabitants.",501,51110,201505
Imagine one that believes that animals have a right to flourish and aren’t just a means to the end of human satisfaction.,501,51110,201505
Imagine one that believes the common good embraces other species and not just our own.,501,51110,201505
"That’s what a real political party, the Green Party, does.",501,51110,201505
"The Earth is our home, and this is what we are doing to it: We have lost half the wild animals on Earth in the past 40 years.",501,51110,201505
"We lose between 200 and 100,000 species every year.",501,51110,201505
"This is between 1,000 and 10,000 times faster than the natural extinction rate.",501,51110,201505
We are causing a ‘sixth extinction’.,501,51110,201505
The other five occurred naturally; this one is down to us.,501,51110,201505
We have increased CO2 concentrations from a pre-industrial 280 parts per million (ppm) to about 400 ppm.,501,51110,201505
Global temperatures are due to rise between 1.5 and 4.8 degrees C by 2100.,501,51110,201505
And that’s just the internationally agreed range without feedback effects.,501,51110,201505
Many experts are predicting rises as high as 6 degrees C.,501,51110,201505
For the first time in the history of the Earth one species is changing it forever – the human species.,501,51110,201505
They call this new era the ‘Anthropocene’.,501,51110,201505
We now have our very own geological epoch.,501,51110,201505
"This brings with it massive responsibilities, which no other party understands or acknowledges.",501,51110,201505
"The rich and powerful, in particular, have spent too long treating the Earth like an indestructible storehouse, to be thoughtlessly pillaged of its natural resources.",416,51110,201505
"UK biodiversity is threatened by development and agricultural practices such as intensive farming, the draining of wetlands and the deforesting of hills.",501,51110,201505

Overfishing is devastating marine ecosystems.,501,51110,201505
"Our attitude to the natural world is epitomised by the fact that some circuses still tour with wild animals, including zebras, lions, snakes, tigers and camels.",501,51110,201505
The Green Party will put policies in place that will stop us treating other species and the wider environment as a means to the satisfaction of humans only.,501,51110,201505
This is because the common good includes other species too.,501,51110,201505
We depend on them for our own welfare.,501,51110,201505
Every second breath we take is made possible by phytoplankton releasing oxygen into the oceans.,501,51110,201505
"As the oceans acidify and heat up through global warming, their capacity to ‘fix’ CO2 and release oxygen is compromised.",501,51110,201505
"This is interdependence at work, and we ride roughshod over it at our peril.",501,51110,201505
But we should also care for other species because the planet is their home too; we share it with them and we need to take their interests and well-being – as well as ours – into account.,501,51110,201505
We need to halt the damage to nature in the UK and return protection of our natural landscapes to a central part in our national life.,501,51110,201505

and long-term low prices for consumers.,412,51110,201505
"In particular, build new reservoirs in the south and east of England.",501,51110,201505
Prohibit developers from being allowed to destroy unique habitats by way of biodiversity offsetting elsewhere.,416,51110,201505
"Because 94% of the biodiversity for which the UK is responsible is found in our Overseas Territories, ensure that conservation of the environment of the Overseas Territories, including their marine areas, is funded to a level equal to their global significance.",107,51110,201505
"We would also immediately extend ratification of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity to all uninhabited territories,",107,51110,201505
and work with territory governments to agree a timeline for ratification of the Convention in all inhabited territories.,107,51110,201505
Greens in power carry out our policies,305,51110,201505
The Green-led administration in Brighton has secured open access to more green space in perpetuity.,501,51110,201505
"It declared over 800 acres of Council-owned downland and farmland as ‘open access land’, meaning residents can freely use land that was once closed to them.",501,51110,201505
"It added another 670 acres in July 2014, protected in perpetuity.",501,51110,201505
"Market forces and government policies have favoured increasing industrialisation of agriculture, mass-produced food and dependence on fossil fuels.",416,51110,201505
"This comes with great ‘external costs’ to the environment, human health, farming people and animal welfare.",416,51110,201505
"Soil erosion, depletion of water resources, pollution, loss of biodiversity and animal suffering are commonplace.",416,51110,201505
"In addition, agriculture accounts for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions,",416,51110,201505
and pressure on land resources is linked with deforestation in many parts of the world.,416,51110,201505
"But food supply and farming are not just another business, and we need to ensure: That nutritious food is available to everyone at prices they can afford;",416,51110,201505
Decent rural livelihoods and support for rural communities;,416,51110,201505
That there is national and international food security;,416,51110,201505

"In farming, we must move away from the intensification and industrialisation of animal farming.",501,51110,201505
Sustainable farming means animals freed from cages and returned to the land.,501,51110,201505
We will end factory farming and enforce strict animal welfare standards.,501,51110,201505

Take action over other sports or entertainment that cause suffering to animals.,501,51110,201505
Ensure UK taxpayers’ money is not used to fund bullfighting.,501,51110,201505
Ensure greater protection for racing greyhounds and initiate a formal independent review of the industry.,501,51110,201505
Ban the import of fur products.,501,51110,201505
"Work for stronger international protection of endangered sea creatures, and an end to the killing of porpoises, whales and dolphins in all waters and keeping these animals for commercial purposes.",107,51110,201505
Badger culls – inhumane and unscientific,501,51110,201505
"The Green Party has been strongly opposed to the badger cull from the outset, saying that all the evidence showed it would be both inhumane and ineffective at tackling bovine tuberculosis.",501,51110,201505
"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) controversially went ahead with culling by ‘free shooting’ in Gloucestershire and Somerset in 2013.",501,51110,201505
"The trial was a failure, being shown to be both inhumane and ineffective, as predicted.",501,51110,201505
The Coalition has nonetheless chosen to continue to pursue this strategy.,501,51110,201505
In October 2012 Green MP Caroline Lucas secured a major parliamentary debate to challenge the government’s badger policy and led MPs in a successful vote against it.,501,51110,201505
"Greens want to see an end to all animal experimentation and will ensure that research funding is directed away from failing animal disease models and towards modern human biology-based techniques, which offering greater opportunities to cure disease and improve product safety.",501,51110,201505
"We will work to end animal experiments but believe immediate action must be taken to Stop non-medical experiments, experiments using primates, cats and dogs.",501,51110,201505
End the use of live animals in military training.,501,51110,201505
Stop the breeding of and use of genetically altered animals.,501,51110,201505
"End government funding of animal experimentation, including any that is outsourced to other countries.",501,51110,201505
Provide greater funding for non-animal research methods and link funding to a target for developing of humane alternatives to animal experiments.,501,51110,201505
"Increase transparency and ensure publication of all findings of animal research, including negative findings.",501,51110,201505
Introduce a comprehensive system for reviewing animal experiments and initiate a comparison of currently required animal tests with a set of human biology-based tests.,501,51110,201505
"On companion animals Greens will push to: Completely review and update existing dog legislation, particularly relating to dog control.",501,51110,201505
Ensure properly coordinated action on dog fighting.,501,51110,201505
Update the rules on selling animals and tackle problems associated with online advertising of pets and illegal imports.,501,51110,201505
Introduce mandatory licensing of breeders and control on genetic manipulation through breeding to prevent exaggerated characteristics likely to cause suffering.,501,51110,201505
End puppy farming by banning the sale of young puppies unless the mother is present.,501,51110,201505
Introduce regulations that make it illegal to use aversive training aids such as electric shock collars.,501,51110,201505
Greens in power carry out our policies,501,51110,201505
"In Brighton, the Green-led Council ensures that new Council tenancy agreements include a requirement that dogs living in council owned homes should be micro-chipped.",501,51110,201505
This has encouraged more tenants who own dogs to behave responsibly as their pets are much easier to trace.,501,51110,201505
Greens are pro-science.,411,51110,201505
Our policies on everything from climate change to eradicating bovine TB are based on the best possible scientific evidence.,411,51110,201505
"But just because science allows us to do something, that does not mean that we should do it.",416,51110,201505
We oppose nuclear power,416,51110,201505
and the release of genetically modified crops into the environment.,416,51110,201505
"We need to balance our scientific and technological abilities against the social, economic and ethical consequences of using them",416,51110,201505
– including their impact on future generations and other species.,416,51110,201505
"Greens will support the development of technologies that have strong social, economic and environmental benefits.",416,51110,201505
"That is why we support investment in energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy//,",416,51110,201505
which will be vital in helping to secure improvements in people’s quality of life,416,51110,201505
and to combating climate change.,501,51110,201505
"We would: Ensure that adequate government funding goes to research on major environmental issues such as climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss,",501,51110,201505
and less is spent on military research.,105,51110,201505
"Ensure that basic research is adequately funded and is not controlled by large corporations,",403,51110,201505
and gradually increase public spending on scientific research from 0.5% to 1.0% of GDP over the next ten years.,411,51110,201505
"Ensure that scientific research is conducted ethically, with regard in particular to human and animal welfare.",501,51110,201505
Publish freely the results of all publicly funded research.,403,51110,201505
Prevent the patenting of genes and living organisms.,403,51110,201505
What scientists say So... the Green Party... a party of sentimental tree-huggers?,501,51110,201505
"Yes, we do love trees, and many of us take great moral and spiritual solace from the natural world.",501,51110,201505
"But we are also a party of science, and we listen to scientists.",411,51110,201505
"Here is what the Royal Society, the UK’s pre-eminent scientific body, said in its 2012 People and the Planet report (pp. 7–8):",0,51110,201505
"‘First, the world’s 1.3 billion poorest people need to be raised out of extreme poverty.",701,51110,201505
"This is critical to reducing global inequality, and to ensuring the wellbeing of all people...",701,51110,201505
"Second, in the most developed and the emerging economies unsustainable consumption must be urgently reduced.",416,51110,201505
This will entail scaling back or radical transformation of damaging material consumption and emissions,416,51110,201505
"and the adoption of sustainable technologies, and is critical to ensuring a sustainable future for all...",416,51110,201505
"Third, global population growth needs to be slowed and stabilised, but this should by no means be coercive.’",501,51110,201505
We agree.,501,51110,201505
"In the General Election you can vote for the only real party of science or for the parties of neo-liberal economic ideology, which believe in the illusion that we can continue to expand forever on a finite planet.",501,51110,201505
"Reducing the amount of waste we produce and being more careful about how we dispose of it has benefits for our planet, our economy and society as a whole.",501,51110,201505
We want to move towards a jobs-rich circular economy with as much waste minimisation as possible.,501,51110,201505
"We would: Reduce what we use, reuse it when we have finished with it and recycle as a last resort.",501,51110,201505
Provide the framework and the infrastructure to help people make more positive choices.,501,51110,201505
Use taxation and regulation to ensure that products and packaging are designed with a view to what happens to them when they stop being useful and packaging reduced.,501,51110,201505
We want waste designed out and fixing things – making them last – designed in.,501,51110,201505
Follow Scotland in banning waste food and other organic material being sent to landfill.,501,51110,201505
"Increase national spending on recycling and waste disposal by about 50%, an extra £4 billion a year, so that we can do away with damaging incineration and landfill.",501,51110,201505
Aim to recycle 70% of domestic waste by 2020 as a move towards a zero-waste system.,501,51110,201505
"Imagine flicking a switch and knowing that the energy was coming from the sun, the wind, the earth and the tides; energy forever, not just for now.",501,51110,201505
Imagine not having to decide between ‘heating or eating’; no fuel poverty,503,51110,201505
Imagine glancing out of the window and seeing a van arrive to insulate your neighbour’s house as part of a funded nationwide programme – reducing demand as well as creating supply.,501,51110,201505
Imagine your energy bill coming from a community-owned company or cooperative rather than from one of the ‘Big Six’.,403,51110,201505
Imagine being part of the company or cooperative yourself; energy security for us all rather than profits for the few.,403,51110,201505
This is all possible; this is Green Party energy policy.,403,51110,201505
Energy for all without climate change.,501,51110,201505
We all use energy.,503,51110,201505
"It keeps our houses warm, powers much of our transport and home appliances, and cooks our food.",503,51110,201505
"Our lives depend on it and it takes up a large part of our spending, especially if we are poor.",503,51110,201505
Too many people suffer fuel poverty.,503,51110,201505
We get a bad deal on energy.,403,51110,201505
"When wholesale prices go up, the prices for domestic electricity and for fuel at the pumps go up rapidly.",403,51110,201505
"When wholesale prices go down, the retail prices seem to stick.",403,51110,201505
The big energy companies make huge profits but do not serve the common good.,403,51110,201505
We need to put this right and ensure that: Everyone is able to cook and keep warm;,403,51110,201505
"We are charged for what we use, and not penalised for using less;",403,51110,201505
We are not cut off or forced to use pre-payment meters.,403,51110,201505
But burning fossil fuels for energy causes climate change.,501,51110,201505
"If we are to secure a safe and habitable climate for current and future generations, we need a rapid shift to a zero-carbon energy system;",501,51110,201505
we need to leave the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves underground and unburned.,501,51110,201505
"Other ways of getting energy, such as nuclear power, pose other unacceptable risks.",501,51110,201505
So we have to build a secure and affordable energy system that meets our basic needs while protecting our environment.,416,51110,201505
"We believe this requires an energy policy that: Reduces the amount of energy we need, mainly by improving energy efficiency.",416,51110,201505
Ends fuel poverty.,503,51110,201505
Invests massively in renewable generation.,416,51110,201505
"Reorganises the energy generation and supply industry, in particular breaking the dominance of the Big Six suppliers.",403,51110,201505
"Puts community, cooperative and locally owned clean energy generation and supply at the heart of our energy system.",416,51110,201505
"We have to start with climate change, because this drives the degree of urgency with which we change our energy system.",501,51110,201505
The climate is the ultimate common good.,501,51110,201505
"The effects of a rapidly warming climate will affect everyone, but poorer people, in the UK and worldwide, will be the hardest hit.",503,51110,201505
"Many are already struggling to cope with rising sea levels, flooding, drought and extreme weather.",501,51110,201505
Climate change threatens to make parts of the world uninhabitable.,501,51110,201505
Climate refugee numbers will increase.,501,51110,201505
More intense weather events will further affect health and food production and make global conflict more likely.,501,51110,201505
"The science makes it clear that, to avoid the risk of runaway climate change, we must leave around four-fifths of all existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.",501,51110,201505
So the problem now is not too little fossil fuel but too much.,501,51110,201505
Exploiting new sources of unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas and oil and tar sands is incompatible with tackling climate change.,501,51110,201505
"We must reduce our dependency on oil, coal and gas as quickly as possible while developing a society that can thrive on renewable energy.",501,51110,201505
And there’s not much time.,501,51110,201505
"To have a reasonable chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change, we need a 90% reduction in greenhouse gases in the UK in the next 15–20 years",501,51110,201505
and a zero-carbon economy by 2050 (see the box for how we derive these targets).,501,51110,201505
This is much more challenging than the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 in the Climate Change Act 2008.,501,51110,201505
"Although we celebrate, defend and uphold the Climate Change Act, it must also be strengthened.",501,51110,201505
"A Green transformation would have huge benefits: more comfortable homes,",501,51110,201505
"better health,",501,51110,201505
"less pollution,",501,51110,201505
"lots of jobs,",501,51110,201505
and far less dependency on foreign fuel imports.,501,51110,201505
The UK can and must do better: The government’s climate change advisers say we are on track to miss even the government’s unsatisfactory carbon targets.,501,51110,201505
Progress on energy efficiency has plummeted.,501,51110,201505
The government’s Green Deal to save energy in our homes has been a disappointing failure.,501,51110,201505
"The UK is 25th out of 27 in the European renewable energy league table, despite having some of the best resources for renewable energy in Europe.",501,51110,201505
We have the highest level of fuel poverty in Western Europe.,503,51110,201505
Why we need to do better than the Climate Change Act,501,51110,201505
"If the global average temperature rise can be kept below 2 degrees C, runaway or disastrous climate change can be avoided,",501,51110,201505
though severe damage will occur in some parts of the world.,107,51110,201505
"Many countries and civil society organisations argue that the international goal should be to keep to 1.5 degrees C of warming, highlighting the severity of the climate impacts we are already seeing.",107,51110,201505
"All countries including the UK agreed at Copenhagen in 2009 to recognise the need to limit the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees C, despite the fact that the UK’s climate change target means that there is an almost two-thirds (63%) chance of exceeding this 2 degrees C.",107,51110,201505
"To meet the 2 degree C target, the world needs to limit total global emissions over the rest of the century to about 1,000 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2.",107,51110,201505
"Current projections have us exceeding that figure by 2040, leading to devastating average warming of around 4 degrees C by the end of this century.",501,51110,201505
"As the UK has about 1% of the world’s population, its allowable budget would amount to 10 Gt CO2.",701,51110,201505
But the UK is a relatively rich country that has benefited from the world’s highest cumulative historical emissions per person.,503,51110,201505
"The Green Party therefore believes that the UK should plan to emit only half this amount by 2030 (which amounts to around 80 million tonnes CO2 a year by 2030),",503,51110,201505
and have negligible emissions thereafter.,501,51110,201505
This translates into our target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 10% of their 1990 levels by 2030.,501,51110,201505
This goes much further than the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 mandated by the Climate Change Act.,501,51110,201505
"Renewables can supply all the energy we need for a comfortable standard of living, but only if we invest wisely and manage our demand more sensibly – by reducing energy waste and improving efficiency.",416,51110,201505
"The Green Party would seek to cut energy demand by one-third by 2020,",416,51110,201505
one-half by 2030,416,51110,201505
and two-thirds by 2050.,416,51110,201505
The UK already has the technology it needs.,416,51110,201505
"What is lacking is the political will to build a cleaner, home-grown, more local, more affordable, more democratic and ultimately more reliable energy future.",416,51110,201505
Caroline Lucas and fuel poverty,503,51110,201505
"When joint chair of Parliament’s cross-party group on ending fuel poverty and promoting energy efficiency, Green MP Caroline Lucas was a leading advocate of urgent action to end the scandal of cold homes.",503,51110,201505
She initiated a debate in Parliament’s Westminster Hall about curbing the power of the Big Six energy companies,403,51110,201505
"and has asked parliamentary questions, lobbied ministers, spoken in debates and tabled amendments to legislation demanding action on warm homes and lower bills.",503,51110,201505
Caroline has campaigned for home energy efficiency to be made a UK National Infrastructure priority and to be given the necessary funding.,411,51110,201505
"She has stood up in Parliament for an Energy Bill revolution – the creation of the world’s most ambitious home energy-efficiency programme,",501,51110,201505
"which would slash energy bills and carbon emissions,",501,51110,201505
"create over 100,000 jobs",701,51110,201505
and help end the fuel poverty crisis once and for all.,403,51110,201505
Home energy improvement will be central to this drive to accelerate energy saving,501,51110,201505
while ensuring energy is affordable to all.,503,51110,201505
"We will: Provide a free nationwide retrofit insulation programme, concentrating on areas where fuel poverty is most serious.",503,51110,201505
This is designed to insulate 9 million homes in total,501,51110,201505
"and take at least 2 million homes out of fuel poverty,",503,51110,201505
aiming for the Passivhaus ultra low-energy refurbishment standard by 2020.,501,51110,201505
"It will offer up to £5,000 worth of free insulation, or other energy improvements such as solar photovoltaics (PV) if the insulation is already up to the standard, to every home in designated areas.",501,51110,201505
"To reach Passivhaus standards, there will be the option of up to a further £15,000 in subsidised loans from the Green Investment Bank for each dwelling for further improvements.",501,51110,201505
"This programme will invest £45 billion over the course of the Parliament (including investment in training and awareness), be delivered by local authorities",501,51110,201505
"and create well over 100,000 jobs.",701,51110,201505
It will become part of a new Green National Infrastructure programme.,501,51110,201505
"Give tenants the right to require landlords to achieve the same improvement to the energy performance of their home, and require all private rented sector housing to meet Energy Performance Band C by 2025.",501,51110,201505
Require all new homes to be built to the Passivhaus standard.,501,51110,201505
"Support this investment in insulating and building to Passivhaus standards with investment in training for the design and building industries, by creating a national college for training in energy home improvement,",501,51110,201505
"and building relationships with a network of affiliated facilities, including existing colleges and private training providers.",501,51110,201505
Invest too in energy awareness programmes so that people become as aware of the energy performance of their home (and of other buildings too) as they are now of the miles per gallon of their car.,501,51110,201505
Continue a fully funded Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.,501,51110,201505
Provide £4.5 billion over the Parliament to support research and development into less energy-intensive industrial processes.,411,51110,201505
"Prioritise public over private transport,",413,51110,201505
electrification of the transport system,411,51110,201505
and access over mobility.,503,51110,201505
"Give councils the power to insist that communal heating schemes, for example using waste heat from industrial sources, are implemented where practicable.",501,51110,201505
Establish mandatory standards for commercial building performance such as ISO 5001.,501,51110,201505
"Use carbon taxes (based on the present system) to fund investment in energy-efficiency measures,",501,51110,201505
and prepare for the following Parliament a carbon quota scheme to regulate the level of demand for energy.,501,51110,201505
Green councillors make home insulation happen...,501,51110,201505
"Work began last year in Stroud on a five-year £12 million programme planned by Green councillors Phillip Booth and Simon Pickering to improve the energy efficiency of over 1,000 homes in the district.",501,51110,201505
"New local jobs will be created for trades people to install insulation, solar panels and heat pumps.",701,51110,201505
"The four Greens on Kirklees Council secured three years of free home insulation funding, against the active opposition of Labour councillors, who later tried to claim credit!",501,51110,201505
This saved householders around £76 per year at 2011 prices,503,51110,201505
and cut emissions.,501,51110,201505
It also created 243 jobs in the local economy.,701,51110,201505
Carbon quotas – how they would work The fairest way to share emissions rights is equally.,503,51110,201505
"So we support the idea of an economy-wide system of carbon quotas, with everyone guaranteed the same basic entitlement, regardless of wealth.",503,51110,201505
"Those who use less than this could sell some of their quota to those who use more, rewarding their carbon thrift.",501,51110,201505
"About half the available carbon units could be distributed, free of charge, to all adults in the country.",503,51110,201505
The rest of the carbon units could be sold by the government to companies and other organisations.,501,51110,201505
Whenever you bought fossil fuels or electricity your carbon account card would be debited.,501,51110,201505
You would be able to sell excess carbon units – or buy extra units if you need to.,501,51110,201505
"Our vision for the energy system is a diverse mix of public and private participants, including community, cooperative and municipal generation, supply and distribution.",403,51110,201505
We will end the dominance of the Big Six energy companies.,403,51110,201505
"We will stabilise the ‘policy landscape’ for renewable energy to provide certainty for investment decisions, including long-term targets and stable feedin tariffs.",403,51110,201505
"We will: Maximise opportunities for community or municipally owned, or cooperative not-for-profit organisations to generate and supply electricity and heat at the retail level.",403,51110,201505
Set a target for at least 42 gigawatts (GW) of community power by 2020.,403,51110,201505
Require grid operators to give priority access to community energy projects at an affordable cost.,412,51110,201505
Split up the large vertically integrated companies so that they can’t both produce energy and supply it to consumers.,403,51110,201505
Secure public control over the strategic direction and policies of the National Grid.,413,51110,201505
Support long-term stable fixed-price feed-in tariffs for renewable energy generators.,412,51110,201505
"Ensure that consumer energy tariffs are progressive, so small consumers pay less per unit than larger ones,",403,51110,201505
"that special needs are recognised,",503,51110,201505
"that people are not cut off when they can’t afford to pay,",503,51110,201505
and that people are not forced to have prepayment meters.,503,51110,201505
"Ensure that there is a single scheme of regulation for the entire industry,",403,51110,201505
whose objectives include achieving climate change targets,501,51110,201505
as well as protecting consumer interests.,403,51110,201505
Why we say no to fracking,416,51110,201505
"Fracking is a process where water, sand and chemicals are injected at high pressure into shale rocks under the ground to release shale gas or oil.",416,51110,201505
Three years ago we called for a moratorium on fracking-related activity while the environmental and economic impacts of drilling for shale gas were evaluated.,416,51110,201505
"On that basis, we are now emphatic and unambiguous in proposing an outright ban on fracking and related extreme energy technologies (coal-bed methane and underground coal gasification, as well as hydraulic fracturing).",416,51110,201505
Fracking is incompatible with the UK’s climate change obligations.,416,51110,201505
There is already around five times more fossil fuel globally than we can safely burn if are to avoid dangerous climate change.,501,51110,201505
Encouraging a whole new fossil fuel industry is deeply irresponsible and undermines international efforts to secure a global climate agreement.,416,51110,201505
Fracking will put communities and our environment at risk.,416,51110,201505
"There are serious and legitimate concerns about the potential for fracking to cause water contamination, air pollution and harm to wildlife and public health.",416,51110,201505
"Fracking sites would entail mass lorry movements, blighting our countryside and villages.",416,51110,201505
The Green Party strategy for energy efficiency ensures that we can change to an energy system based mainly on electricity from renewables within 15–20 years (a little longer for transport).,416,51110,201505
This will require substantial investment over the period.,416,51110,201505
We also need to pay more attention to energy storage.,416,51110,201505
"So we will: Invest substantial amounts of public money (up to £35 billion over the Parliament) in renewable generation and in the National Grid, if necessary, to make sure renewable generation grows quickly enough.",416,51110,201505
This would include both large-scale generation and small- and medium-scale renewable generation schemes funded through local authorities.,416,51110,201505
This capacity would not necessarily be publicly owned and would include community-owned schemes.,416,51110,201505
Give the Green Investment Bank full borrowing powers to help fund this investment.,501,51110,201505
Concentrate on expanding mature renewable technologies such as wind energy and solar PV in the period until 2030,501,51110,201505
"and bringing down costs, in part by reducing planning constraints, including those for onshore wind.",501,51110,201505
"Ensure that all schools, hospitals and other public buildings have solar panels by 2020.",501,51110,201505
"Encourage all social landlords to develop plans to install solar panels on all suitable properties, building on Kirklees Council’s pioneering £10 million plan to install solar panels on 2,000 Council homes over the next two years.",501,51110,201505
Schemes such as these can save people on low incomes the equivalent of up to two weeks’ rent.,503,51110,201505
"Set deployment targets to bring down costs and attract investment in manufacturing and supply chains,",402,51110,201505
aiming for 42 GW of offshore wind by 2020,501,51110,201505
"and 60 GW by 2030,",501,51110,201505
and for 25 GW of solar PV by 2020.,501,51110,201505
"Spend £2.5 billion over the Parliament on an intensive research and deployment programme for other renewables such as wave and tidal stream generators or other approaches,",501,51110,201505
and also for storage technologies.,501,51110,201505
"Phase out fossil-fuel-based generation, including the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2023 at the very latest.",501,51110,201505
Phase out nuclear power within ten years.,501,51110,201505
Ban all UK fracking operations – following a growing number of nations worldwide – and withdraw all relevant licences as soon as possible.,416,51110,201505
Ban other new fossil fuel developments such as other unconventional fossil fuels and open cast coal.,416,51110,201505
"End fossil fuel industry tax breaks, phase out other harmful fossil fuel subsidies (domestic and international) and use the money saved to help fund other parts of our energy programme.",416,51110,201505
"Work with financial institutions, local councils and others to encourage divestment from fossil fuels and develop alternative investment in efficiency and renewables programmes.",416,51110,201505
Support the potential deployment of carbon capture and storage to existing biomass and gas power stations only as a transitional technology.,416,51110,201505
Develop biomass generation only where it can be done in a sustainable way giving regard to the environmental and human costs of some large-scale biomass fuel operations.,416,51110,201505
Set in law a decarbonisation target for the power sector of 25–50 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030.,501,51110,201505
"Expand electricity storage capacity, including using the potential storage capacity of electric vehicles, and develop the commercial and regulatory framework to make this a reality.",501,51110,201505
Introduce smart meters and appliances.,416,51110,201505
"Apart from rebuilding the UK’s energy system, we also need to adapt to the climate change that will take place as the effects of past emissions work their way through the system.",501,51110,201505
In the UK there will be wetter winters and hotter and drier summers.,501,51110,201505
"We can expect greater instability, with more episodes of extreme weather, such as the heavy rain and floods of the 2013–14 winter.",501,51110,201505
We need to begin urgently to prepare for this by: Providing help for people and communities to prepare for an increasingly variable climate.,501,51110,201505
We would give an extra £1 billion a year to local authorities and the Environment Agency to spend on assisting communities with flood protection,501,51110,201505
"and on defending homes and public buildings, such as hospitals, from heat waves.",501,51110,201505
Obliging government departments and local authorities to consider climate change and carbon reduction in all their planning over a long time horizon of 50–100 years.,501,51110,201505
"Specifically, local authorities should do so in all planning decisions.",501,51110,201505
Having the government act as an insurer of last resort where commercial insurance companies are refusing to provide flood cover.,501,51110,201505
Preventing new building on flood plains.,501,51110,201505
"Encouraging storing water in uplands through full river system management – including wetland restoration, natural regeneration, allowing rivers to meander and allowing flooding upstream.",501,51110,201505
Water management needs to become part of the rules for farming subsidies.,501,51110,201505
"Green councillor sets the pace on flooding.. Thanks to a lone Green councillor, who at the time held the balance of power, Islington became the first UK Council to set a minimum amount of ‘permeable’ land to prevent flooding.",501,51110,201505
Nuclear energy – it’s still no thanks,416,51110,201505
"In recent years, the nuclear industry has tried to re-brand itself as ‘green’.",416,51110,201505
"As the UK’s only environmental party, the Green Party needs to set out why it still considers that nuclear is no answer to either climate change or our energy needs.",416,51110,201505
Nuclear energy is not green.,416,51110,201505
"Uncertainties involved in carbon costing, radioactive waste management and the carbon costs of obtaining uranium mean that the carbon costs of nuclear are unknowable.",416,51110,201505
"Unlike renewables, we simply cannot rely on it being low carbon.",416,51110,201505
"In addition to its highly dubious ‘low-carbon’ credentials, nuclear energy is a seriously flawed policy in other ways:",416,51110,201505
"Nuclear energy is extremely expensive: not one nuclear plant has ever been built, anywhere in the world by private investors without huge public subsidies.",416,51110,201505
"The Coalition government has agreed to guarantee EDF nearly double the current market electricity price at Hinkley, in addition to other financial backing not available to other low-carbon generators.",416,51110,201505
These subsidies would impose enormous and unjustifiable costs on householders and businesses.,416,51110,201505
Nuclear remains a uniquely dangerous form of energy.,416,51110,201505
"If the new plant being built by EDF at Hinkley were to release an equivalent amount of radiation to Fukushima, and the wind was in the south-west, Bristol would need to be permanently evacuated.",416,51110,201505
No long-term solution has yet been found to the question of dealing with nuclear waste.,416,51110,201505
"Wind power has been found to create around 12 times as many jobs as the same investment in nuclear, and solar power is estimated to create around 360 times as many jobs.",501,51110,201505
Investing in energy efficiency (e.g. insulation) creates even more jobs.,501,51110,201505
Renewables can provide the same ‘base load’ production as nuclear power at a lower cost without the risks.,416,51110,201505
"Nuclear power diverts investment, skills and expertise away from securing the economic, employment and energy security benefits of home-grown renewables, smart grids and demand reduction.",416,51110,201505
"The current UK nuclear programme is planned around a reactor design, the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR), which has an atrocious construction and cost record.",416,51110,201505
EPRs being built in France and Finland are years behind schedule and have huge cost overruns.,416,51110,201505
"Even if nuclear were the answer, the EPR would still be the wrong plant to build.",416,51110,201505
More equal societies almost always do better than unequal ones – and that’s true for the well-off as well as for the poor.,503,51110,201505
"Almost every modern social and environmental problem – ill health, lack of community life, violence, drugs, obesity, mental illness, long working hours, big prison populations – is more likely to occur in a less equal society.",503,51110,201505
"Imagine a world in which everyone is respected whatever their ethnicity, gender, age, religious belief or non-belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, class, size, disability or other status.",503,51110,201505
Imagine a world in which no one earns more than ten times what anyone else earns.,503,51110,201505
"We’d all be healthier, happier and more confident.",503,51110,201505
This could be the real world the Green Party creates.,503,51110,201505
"The Green Party is opposed to inequality not just because it is wrong in itself and because more equal societies are happier societies,",503,51110,201505
but because it fosters inappropriate growth.,416,51110,201505
We are encouraged to measure our prosperity by comparing it with the material conditions of others.,416,51110,201505
Celebrity culture and the lifestyles of the rich create a climate of envy and a desire to match them.,416,51110,201505
This fuels consumption that satisfies pointless wants for some rather than vital needs for all.,416,51110,201505
Growth justifies inequality.,416,51110,201505
It is claimed that: if the economy gets bigger some benefit will ‘trickle down’ to the poor and vulnerable;,416,51110,201505
A rising tide floats all boats – forgetting that not everyone has a boat.,416,51110,201505
"However, recent research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) confirms that this theory is just wrong.",416,51110,201505
"In a resource-constrained world, equality makes much more sense than inequality.",503,51110,201505
"Our taxation, pay and social security plans will make the UK a materially more equal society.",503,51110,201505
Equality is a matter not just of material goods but of treating people fairly – celebrating diversity rather than punishing it.,503,51110,201505
The Green Party aims to treat everyone equally and fairly.,503,51110,201505
We will: Reinstate the funding for the Equality and Human Rights Commission.,201,51110,201505
"Make equality and diversity lessons mandatory in all schools, from the first year of primary education onwards, to combat all forms of prejudice and bullying,",503,51110,201505

Continue to tackle institutional racism in the police force and the wider criminal justice system.,503,51110,201505
"Require all police forces to have equality and diversity liaison officers whose remit is to tackle and take preventive action on crimes originating in discrimination against any group,",503,51110,201505
and to treat crimes arising from such discrimination on a par with racist crimes.,503,51110,201505

Stonewall put the Green-led Brighton Council in first place in their 2014 Education Equality Index.,503,51110,201505
"Stonewall has described the Council as ‘leading the way’ in celebrating difference and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.",503,51110,201505
"Brighton Council also introduced the landmark trans scrutiny panel, looking how to address transphobia in the city.",503,51110,201505
"Of the 37 initial recommendations, 25 have started or been implemented, including addressing transphobia in schools,",503,51110,201505
allowing genderless honorifics for Council documentation,503,51110,201505
and easing access to healthcare for trans people.,503,51110,201505
"Despite recent modest advances, discrimination against LGBTIQ people remains in areas such as housing, education, employment and health.",503,51110,201505
"The Green Party supports campaigns to advance LGBTIQ rights and aims to build a society where everyone is valued, respected and empowered, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.",503,51110,201505

Press the Commonwealth to grant accredited status to a Commonwealth LGBTIQ Association and to urge all member states to end the criminalisation of homosexuality and to protect LGBTIQ citizens against discrimination and hate crime.,503,51110,201505
Joining up the policies Anti-discrimination policies on their own aren’t enough.,503,51110,201505
It’s vital to see the connections between one policy decision and its effects elsewhere in society.,503,51110,201505
"Cuts and austerity measures have a disproportionate effect on LGBTIQ people because of higher levels of reliance on public services due to family estrangement, societal and workplace discrimination, and specific healthcare needs.",503,51110,201505
"Likewise, cuts in youth, housing and social services are more likely to affect young LGBTIQ people, particularly those who are estranged from their families.",503,51110,201505
LGBTIQ people are more likely to face unemployment and the impact of this can be much greater because they may not be able to rely on wider social networks.,503,51110,201505
"Cuts to services for older and disabled people will have a much greater impact on LGBTIQ people, who are less likely to have children and will be more reliant on public services.",503,51110,201505
"So, restoring the public realm contributes to equality and diversity.",503,51110,201505
"Since 2010, recent progress in advancing women’s equality has been undermined and reversed",503,51110,201505
Women are now: Poorer – nearly three-quarters of the government’s ‘savings’ have been paid for by women;,503,51110,201505
"Earning less – the value of low pay in particular is declining, and the pay gap between men and women in their twenties has doubled;",503,51110,201505
"Over-burdened – as support services have been slashed, women are left carrying the load;",503,51110,201505
and More at risk of gendered violence – because funding for services that support survivors of sexual and domestic violence has been reduced.,503,51110,201505
This is all a consequence of deliberate government action.,503,51110,201505
"The Public Sector Equality Duty, which assesses the impact of gove ivered, is designed to solve problems in isolation – the lack of a job or of a place to live, an illness – but problems usually arise together.",305,51110,201505

Increase the budget for Disability Living Allowance / Personal Independence Payments by around £1 billion a year.,504,51110,201505
"Retain the Independent Living Fund, which enables over 18,000 severely disabled people to stay in their home instead of being in residential care, costing around £300 million a year.",504,51110,201505
Provide a further £0.5 billion for free social care for adults aged 18–65 who have a proven care need.,504,51110,201505
"Increase the Carer’s Allowance by 50%, costing £1.2 billion a year (6.5 million carers save the state £119 billion),",504,51110,201505
and provide carers with a legal right to 5–10 days paid annual leave.,504,51110,201505

"In Malvern, Worcestershire, Green councillor John Raines led the campaign to allow the community to buy a Council-owned youth centre earmarked for demolition and housing development.",606,51110,201505
It is now thriving under community ownership.,606,51110,201505
Age used to be respected.,706,51110,201505
"Now there’s the beginning of a backlash against older people, particularly the baby boomer generation approaching their seventies.",706,51110,201505
"They’ve had it easy, it’s said – secure jobs, final salary pensions, good health and a housing market that has rewarded them but made it almost impossible for today’s young people to get housed.",706,51110,201505
"And, as a generation, they have despoiled the planet and their swelling numbers threaten to bankrupt our health and pension systems.",706,51110,201505
The real picture is more complex.,706,51110,201505
"There are huge inequalities between older people, and many have had difficult lives.",503,51110,201505
The free university education of the past was a privilege for a tiny group of people.,503,51110,201505
Many more working lives were totally disrupted by Margaret Thatcher’s assault on manufacturing industry in the 1980s – these older people bear the scars of industrial diseases and health inequalities.,503,51110,201505
Many older women in particular have lead lives confined by lack of opportunity.,503,51110,201505
The Green Party’s policy for older people is simple.,706,51110,201505
"First they are people, and they have the same rights and hopes as everyone else.",503,51110,201505
"They should be treated fairly and equally in employment, education, healthcare and avenues for enterprise.",503,51110,201505
Ambition should not be shut off just because we get older.,503,51110,201505
"Second, there are certain things they should be able to rely on without the indignity of means testing.",504,51110,201505
The most basic is a universal state pension.,504,51110,201505
"We would introduce a Citizen’s Pension, paid to all pensioners regardless of contribution record from 2016, so no pensioner will live in poverty.",504,51110,201505
"It will pay £180 per week to a single pensioner and £310 per week for a couple, taking all pensioners above the poverty line.",504,51110,201505
Future increases will be at the higher of the price increases of basic goods and services or average earnings.,504,51110,201505
The failure of private pensions – making pensions secure Private pension schemes have failed.,504,51110,201505
The £40 billion government subsidy given to private pension schemes in the form of income tax and National Insurance reliefs is huge.,504,51110,201505
The performance of the private pensions industry is dismal – the total paid out in private pensions each year is no more than the subsidy that the government gives the industry.,504,51110,201505
We will begin to reform this.,504,51110,201505
We would raise part of the money needed for the Citizen’s Pension by abolishing about half of the value of these concessions; the money is better invested in a better pension for all.,504,51110,201505
"We would further limit the amount of relief an individual can get on contributions in any one year, so that more of the subsidy goes to the lower paid.",504,51110,201505
"We would make saving for retirement safe and predictable, by offering a new state earnings-related pension scheme.",504,51110,201505
"This would invest through the Green Investment Bank in long-term public assets such as the railways, renewable energy and the National Grid, social and affordable housing, projects sponsored by local authorities, and public facilities such as hospitals.",501,51110,201505
"These assets offer a safe, long-term and predictable rate of return – ideal for pensions – and the pension fund will provide the savings needed to invest in these assets.",504,51110,201505
"Such public assets would replace pension fund assets, many of which consist of shares in energy companies whose main assets are unusable fossil fuel reserves.",501,51110,201505
"Employers would be obliged to offer and contribute to this pension scheme, as they are now with stakeholder pensions;",504,51110,201505
"the default would be for employees to be contracted in to the scheme, and a person’s contributions would be unaffected by changes of employer.",504,51110,201505
In addition we will: Provide free social care funded by taxation on the same basis as the NHS.,504,51110,201505
Keep the pensioners’ bus pass and Winter Fuel Payment.,504,51110,201505
"Provide free prescriptions for all and abolish the TV licence, making the current concessions unnecessary.",504,51110,201505
Support enforcing the rights of older people through the Dignity Code.,503,51110,201505
Make sure that all pensioners living abroad receive the same pension and annual pension increase as those living in the UK.,504,51110,201505
"Support 20 mph zones, cycle schemes and public transport to make our streets safe and useful for older as well as young people.",501,51110,201505
"Keep the NHS a public service, comprehensive and free at the point of delivery,",504,51110,201505
especially recognising that the current generation of older people have paid for it all their lives and are now beginning to need it.,504,51110,201505
"As is traditional, we have listed here items that are specifically in the interests of older people.",706,51110,201505
"But we hope and believe that many older people will vote with their children and grandchildren in mind as much as themselves, and that they will in particular have in mind the long-term threats to our climate and environment.",501,51110,201505
"Green councillors look after older people...In 2012, Green councillor David Brookes was appointed the elderly people’s champion for Lancaster City Council and has persuaded the Council to advertise almshouse charity vacancies on its lettings site and to devote a web page to events and issues for the elderly.",503,51110,201505
"In Bradford, Greens secured £300,000 to fund free cavity wall and loft insulation for older residents.",503,51110,201505
"Joining up the policies So what do health, food, equality and transport have to do with each other?",501,51110,201505
"We all know that, to be healthy we need to eat well and take more exercise.",501,51110,201505
"So if we promote healthy eating, local food, good free school meals and active transport, we will be healthier.",501,51110,201505
"And if we are all more equal, not only will we be healthier but more of us will use public transport and standards will rise.",501,51110,201505
"And if as a result we are healthier, we’ll be more inclined to get an allotment, walk to the bus stop and get a bus, reducing climate change-producing gases.",501,51110,201505
It’s a virtuous circle.,501,51110,201505
Imagine a National Health Society.,504,51110,201505
"Imagine living in a clean environment, with satisfying work, good housing, a balanced diet, a good education, active, safe and sustainable transport, and much greater equality.",503,51110,201505
This is well-being – so vital to good health.,503,51110,201505
"Imagine being in no doubt that the health service is publicly funded, with free prescriptions, dentistry and chiropody; one in which you have a human relationship with your doctors and nurses, who make your care their principal aim.",504,51110,201505
"A health service in which individual and local knowledge take the place of protocols and pathways,",504,51110,201505
and free social and nursing care is provided for the elderly;,504,51110,201505
"one which prizes prompt and local access to care, and encourages a culture of prevention as well as cure.",504,51110,201505
"Imagine a system that respects and trusts health professionals and gives them the time, space, training and rewards to do their job.",504,51110,201505
This could be the real health service; it is the Green Party’s joined-up approach to health and well-being.,504,51110,201505
The Green Party believes healthcare shouldn’t be bought and sold.,413,51110,201505
"All the other parties have encouraged the marketisation and privatisation of provision and this has led to: Fragmentation of services, with patients falling into gaps between providers, and poor communication between clinicians;",413,51110,201505
"Outsourcing, with companies cutting corners to win contracts;",413,51110,201505

An increase in administration costs of 9% of the NHS budget.,413,51110,201505
"We will maintain a publicly funded, publicly provided health service free at the point of use.",413,51110,201505
"Money spent on health will remain in the public economy, supporting the NHS rather than going into private companies’ profits.",413,51110,201505
"We will: Repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and introduce an NHS Reinstatement Bill restoring the obligation upon the government to provide a comprehensive health service,",413,51110,201505
"abolishing competition and the purchaser–provider split ,",413,51110,201505

Stop further private finance initiative (PFI) contracts and end the inappropriate sale of NHS assets.,413,51110,201505
"Seek ways to buy out existing PFI contracts where that would represent good value for money, and set aside up to £5 billion over the Parliament to do so.",413,51110,201505
Restore the public sector ethos of partnership between staff and patients.,413,51110,201505
Caroline Lucas opposing the Health and Social Care Act 2012 in Parliament:,413,51110,201505
"‘The Bill opens the way for private companies to determine much of English health care and takes away the government’s duties and powers, which is why I believe it should be opposed.’",413,51110,201505
‘Either we want an NHS free at the point of delivery and with free eye tests and so forth or we do not.’,413,51110,201505
Caroline has since introduced the NHS Reinstatement Bill.,413,51110,201505
The Coalition government has not increased funding to keep up with inflation and increasing demand – indeed it has continued ‘efficiency savings’.,504,51110,201505
And money has been diverted into the cost of reorganisation and into profits for the private companies now running many services.,504,51110,201505
"The result is one in four people going to crowded A&E Departments because they could not see a GP quickly enough,",504,51110,201505
and a crisis in mental health care.,504,51110,201505
"International comparisons underline that we can spend more – we spend just 9.6% of GDP on health (including private healthcare), the French 11.7%, the Germans 11.5% and the USA an astonishing 17.6%.",504,51110,201505
"We would: Immediately increase the overall NHS budget by £12 billion a year to overcome the current funding crisis, increase investment in mental health care and provide for free dentistry, chiropody and prescriptions in England.",504,51110,201505
"Thereafter, increase the overall NHS budget annually in real terms by 1.2% to take account of our ageing population.",504,51110,201505
Together with the previous item this will raise NHS budgets by about £20 billion by 2020.,504,51110,201505
Increase alcohol and tobacco taxes to help fund the annual increases in NHS spending over the Parliament.,504,51110,201505
"Provide free social care as well as free healthcare for older people along the lines of the report from the Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England (Barker report), at an additional cost of around £8 billion a year initially but rising to £9 billion by the end of the Parliament.",504,51110,201505
"Provide free social care at the end of life, enabling dying people to choose where they die.",504,51110,201505
"We would also: Provide accessible, local community health centres that provide a wide range of services, including out-of-hours care.",504,51110,201505
These will help people access healthcare quickly rather than being a replacement for GPs.,504,51110,201505
End phony patient choice.,504,51110,201505
"For most of us patient choice is much less important than getting good treatment at our local hospital or health centre – which is often, for many, the only practical choice.",504,51110,201505
Listen to and work in partnership with third sector organisations that are championing patient care.,504,51110,201505
Ensure that all cost-effective treatments are available to all patients who need them.,504,51110,201505

"to setting targets on recycling in NHS Trusts,",501,51110,201505
and the issue of waste disposal.,501,51110,201505
A colossal amount of material waste is produced through the disposable culture that has taken hold in the fight against hospital-acquired infections.,501,51110,201505
"Green councillors support NHS dentistry...The market town of Stowmarket, Suffolk, became the first in the county to open a new NHS dentist surgery after a lengthy campaign by Green councillors.",504,51110,201505
The Green Party takes a whole society approach to health.,504,51110,201505
We care about what happens before you access the NHS.,504,51110,201505
"Get that right, and a lot else falls into place.",504,51110,201505
How to achieve this affects how we organise the health service.,504,51110,201505
"Those involved in primary and community care – GPs, practice nurses, district nurses, health visitors, midwives, counsellors, pharmacists, occupational therapists and all the other community based professionals – are best placed to prevent ill health from developing in the first place.",504,51110,201505
"They can carry out checks and give advice or treatment to people who, for instance, are stressed, obese, inactive, or alcohol or nicotine dependent.",504,51110,201505
Intervention by a trusted health professional can make the difference at an individual level.,504,51110,201505
"This can often be linked to local services, such as advice centres, opportunities for physical activity, lunch clubs and so on.",504,51110,201505
And it’s primary care that is most important in dealing with problems before they become acute and require costly and distressing interventions such as admission to hospital.,504,51110,201505
"Local health professionals can also manage chronic illnesses such as diabetes, respiratory and cardiac conditions and mental illness in ways that are both more patient centred and less expensive than hospitalbased care.",504,51110,201505
They are best placed too to integrate medical and social care.,504,51110,201505
"Where parents want it and there are no medical complications, normal childbirth could take place at home, increasing satisfaction for the woman in labour and reducing costs for the NHS.",504,51110,201505
"Similarly, many people would prefer to spend their last days at home rather than in hospital and a small increase in community care would save hospital beds and make the experience better for the dying patient, their family and friends.",504,51110,201505
We would therefore place more emphasis on prevention and on primary and community care and less on hospitals.,504,51110,201505
We would: Restore the proportion of NHS funding for primary care from the present 7% to 2005 levels (11%) and review the case for increasing it further;,504,51110,201505
we would also ensure that the distribution of funding reflects the local need.,504,51110,201505
Always consider whether services currently offered in or by hospitals could be transferred to the community.,504,51110,201505
"Look for low-tech, local solutions as well as technical advances.",504,51110,201505
"Encourage cooperation between all the primary care providers, e.g. pharmacies and hearing, optical and old age care organisations.",504,51110,201505
"Tackle air pollution, which causes an estimated 29,000 premature deaths each year in the UK.",501,51110,201505
"UK and EU standards on air pollution are out of date, and we would follow more rigorous standards that respect World Health Organization guidelines.",501,51110,201505
"Give special attention to the well-being of children from conception to 2 years old, the first 1001 days.",503,51110,201505
"For example, there should be national investment in evidence-based parenting programmes in order to improve the life chances of children and the well-being of families,",503,51110,201505
and a free and universal early education and childcare service should be introduced.,504,51110,201505
"Extend VAT at the standard rate to less healthy foods, including sugar, but spend the money raised on subsidising around one-third of the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables.",504,51110,201505
"This could prevent around 5,000 premature deaths every year.",504,51110,201505
Put a minimum price on alcohol of 50p per unit.,412,51110,201505
"This will reduce the physical, psychological and social harm associated with problem drinking, and will have only a negligible impact on those who drink in moderation.",504,51110,201505
"Put the UK at the centre of efforts to end the AIDS, TB and malaria epidemics and the threat they pose to the health of women, men and children living in poverty.",107,51110,201505
"Treat drug addiction as a health problem rather than a crime, making drugs policy the responsibility of the Department of Health in order to ensure that resources are targeted at supporting, not punishing, drug users.",504,51110,201505
"Adopt an evidence-based approach to the step-by-step regulation, starting with cannabis, of the drugs currently banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act as well as ‘legal highs’, with a view to introducing a system that reduces harms and brings the market under state control as a potential tax revenue generator.",403,51110,201505
"A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use.",403,51110,201505
"Introduce a regime of presumed consent for organ donation, which respects the right of relatives to refuse consent.",201,51110,201505

"The Green Party listens to knowledge and experience, not political dogma",305,51110,201505
"The Green Party would: Place the quality of patient care, especially patient safety, at the heart of the system.",504,51110,201505

"Foster whole-heartedly the growth, development and training of all staff, including their involvement in improving the systems in which they work.",504,51110,201505
"Embrace transparency in the interests of sharing best practice, accountability and cooperation.",504,51110,201505
"Use quantitative data to better understand how the system is working, not to set targets, and to see them as a route to continuously improving patient care, not an end in themselves.",504,51110,201505
"Ensure that there are clear lines of responsibility, especially for safety and interdepartmental cooperation.",504,51110,201505
Respect the NHS Pay Review Body and bring NHS pay back in line with inflation and negotiate improved conditions.,504,51110,201505
Expand the workforce to drive the wholesale improvement of mental health services.,504,51110,201505
"The extra funding proposed for the NHS and social care will create a total of 400,000 jobs.",504,51110,201505

The government’s own Chief Medical Officer says mental health should be given greater priority.,504,51110,201505
It will take time to train more staff and expand services but the Green Party will put an end to mental health’s Cinderella status and achieve parity of esteem by 2020.,504,51110,201505
We will: Ensure that spending on mental health care rises within our overall commitment to increase real spending on health.,504,51110,201505

"These findings are why we want to create a universal high-quality early years education system used by everyone, to give every child the best possible start.",503,51110,201505
Great credit is due to the previous Labour government for its Sure Start children’s centres. But too many of these have closed as a result of austerity.,503,51110,201505
"Although support for childcare has grown under the Coalition, the government provides scant support to parents in the first two years of a child’s life, and too much of the emphasis for the next three years is on expanding free and subsidised childcare so that parents, especially women, can work.",506,51110,201505

Greens in power carry out our policies,501,51110,201505

"The 2013 GCSE results were the best ever, though they fell in 2014 after tougher marking was introduced across the country.",305,51110,201505

And 80% of sixth forms and colleges are good or outstanding as judged by Ofsted.,305,51110,201505
Higher education is in crisis.,506,51110,201505
"The fundamental purpose of universities should be to promote critical enquiry, social innovation and cultural renewal.",506,51110,201505
But these aims have been sidelined in an atmosphere of increasing managerialism and commercialisation.,506,51110,201505
Higher education is vital to our cultural health.,502,51110,201505
"It should be concerned with public engagement and increasing social participation, not considered merely a production line for enhancing the earning power of individuals.",502,51110,201505
The current focus on research ‘outputs’– in the narrow definition used by the Research Excellence Framework – means that the crucial role of lecturers as teachers has been denigrated.,506,51110,201505
This emphasis needs to be reversed.,506,51110,201505
"The Conservative-led Coalition and the Labour Party bear responsibility for the current system of university funding, which is largely dependent on tuition fees that now stand at £9,000 a year for undergraduates.",506,51110,201505
"This was a betrayal of a promise and has blighted the future of thousands of young people who now graduate with a debt of at least £45,000.",506,51110,201505
"With the removal of public funding from most undergraduate and all postgraduate courses, UK universities are now all but privatised.",413,51110,201505
"The only people to benefit from the current system are university Vice-Chancellors and senior bureaucrats, who award themselves massive pay rises, while those on the ground who carry out teaching and research face ever more punishing terms and conditions of employment.",503,51110,201505
"In practice, this severely compromises the quality of education through reduced student-contact hours with overstretched staff.",506,51110,201505
"Zero-hours contracts are now commonplace and shocking disparities in pay characterise every campus, especially among service workers, who are commonly denied a living wage.",701,51110,201505
"Conversely, university administrative departments continue to swell as money is routinely wasted on copying expensive private sector practices – including ludicrous rebranding exercises – in search of ‘market share’.",413,51110,201505
"The future of the arts and the humanities has been endangered by a systematic denigration by the dominant political parties and university administrations alike, who create a perception of such courses as an expensive luxury without the vocational ‘use-value’ that renders them worth the financial risk.",502,51110,201505
"The Green Party believes that the arts and humanities have an essential part to play in creating a more democratic, sane and participatory society.",502,51110,201505
The situation for mature students is even more dire.,506,51110,201505
"Over the past five years, every continuing education department in the UK has been scaled back or closed down altogether, often as a managerial response to caps on students numbers and diminished funding for the sector as a whole.",506,51110,201505
Adults wishing to return to education are faced with a situation where short courses and part-time study are considered not cost-effective in market terms.,506,51110,201505
"In December 2010, just after the trebling of tuition fees, Caroline Lucas MP argued that the costs of a free higher education could be met by increasing corporation tax for larger companies to the level paid in other G7 countries and ring-fencing some of that money.",506,51110,201505
"Businesses depend enormously on graduates’ skills and knowledge, so it’s only fair that they invest in the higher education system from which they benefit.",503,51110,201505
"Allied to this, the cost of studying the qualifications that universities stipulate as entry requirements is prohibitive.",506,51110,201505
An ‘A’ level for those who are not registered as school or college students attracts a fee of several hundred pounds.,506,51110,201505
"Access to education diplomas are also meshed within a loan system for those over the age of 24, and uniformly cost in excess of £3,000.",506,51110,201505
"The part-time and short courses for which non-traditional applicants can enrol are often hugely expensive, especially when measured against the contact-time with lecturers.",506,51110,201505
‘Lifelong Learning’ is a phrase that is much used by politicians and education professionals.,506,51110,201505
Giving people the opportunity to be ‘second chance’ learners should be a crucial part of what universities offer to wider society.,506,51110,201505
Countering the monetisation of higher education across the entire sector is vital to reverse the destructive and wasteful market model of university education.,413,51110,201505
The Green Party would address this through: Ending undergraduate tuition fees.,506,51110,201505
We appreciate that the current level of applications to study at university reflects the paucity of other opportunities available to young people.,503,51110,201505
This is part of a wider social problem that must be tackled,503,51110,201505
To be saddled with a huge debt for the right to access higher education at the beginning or middle of adulthood is neither ethical nor sustainable.,506,51110,201505
"Because of the way the student loans system works this would cost about £4.5 billion over this Parliament, and in the long run around £8 billion a year.",506,51110,201505
Cancelling student debt issued by the Student Loans Company and held by the government.,506,51110,201505
"Taking account of the loans that it is expected would never be re-paid, the total value of these loans is estimated to be around £30 billion.",506,51110,201505
"Assuming that these loans would be paid off over the next 25 years, and taking account of interest, this amounts to around £2.2 billion a year in revenue that the government would not receive.",506,51110,201505
Reintroducing student grants costing £2.2 billion over the Parliament.,506,51110,201505

"A lack of investment in public housing for at least 20 years, following Right to Buy and restrictions on what local authorities can do;",504,51110,201505

The Green Party will aim for house price stability by making property investment and speculation less attractive and by increasing housing supply.,408,51110,201505

"Reduce VAT on housing renovation and repair work (including insulation) to 5%, costing £1.6 billion a year.",416,51110,201505
At present there is no VAT on constructing new dwellings but there is VAT at 20% on converting and renovating old buildings to be used as homes.,416,51110,201505

Greens in power carry out our housing policies,504,51110,201505
In Green-led Brighton: In November 2012 Brighton Council introduced a new licensing scheme by which private landlords letting a property for sharing by three or more people must bring it up to an agreed standard.,403,51110,201505
"More than 1,500 licences were applied for by April 2014.",403,51110,201505
By July 2014 the Green-led Council had brought some 416 council homes and more than 460 empty private homes back into use.,504,51110,201505
By November 2014 Greens had overseen the delivery of 389 affordable homes (as part of wider residential and mixed developments).,408,51110,201505
Another 130 are due to be completed before May 2015.,408,51110,201505

The ‘bedroom tax’ The ‘under occupancy charge’ – the bedroom tax – came into effect in April 2013.,503,51110,201505
"It affects nearly 500,000 people – the equivalent of a city the size of Leicester.",503,51110,201505
Two-thirds of those affected are disabled.,503,51110,201505
Cash-strapped housing associations have spent millions helping affected tenants.,503,51110,201505
"By February 2014, two-thirds of residents hit by the bedroom tax were in rent arrears.",503,51110,201505
"The Tories devised it, the Lib Dems backed it and Ed Miliband took a year to decide he didn’t like it.",503,51110,201505
Green MP Caroline Lucas has voted against the bedroom tax at every opportunity.,503,51110,201505
"Green councillors and homelessness..In Solihull, Green councillor Chris Williams publicised the plight of a woman who had just had a heart transplant and her 14-yearold daughter who were forced to live in a private hotel for 18 months with rats running through their room as they slept.",503,51110,201505
Since then Solihull has reduced the use of B&Bs to house the homeless.,503,51110,201505
"Imagine a world of sustainable prosperity for all,",701,51110,201505
"one in which secure, satisfying, decently paid jobs are the norm.",701,51110,201505

"Imagine going to a People’s Bank, confident that it is working for you rather than for its shareholders.",503,51110,201505
"Imagine that you and everyone else are being taxed with fairness and sustainability in mind,",503,51110,201505
and that tax is actually collected.,305,51110,201505
Imagine working in a more mixed and localised economy.,403,51110,201505
Imagine a revival of workers’ rights and vibrant trade unions.,701,51110,201505
Imagine knowing that almost half of national income is spent on the common good – on the ties that bind us together – rather than on paying down debts you didn’t cause.,606,51110,201505
"This is the common wealth we create by working together, sharing the fruits of our work fairly and building the infrastructure of our common life.",606,51110,201505
"Right now, society is too unequal,",305,51110,201505
"too much valuable work goes unrecognised,",701,51110,201505
and our infrastructure is not fit for a common and sustainable life.,501,51110,201505
The Green Party’s proposals will make for a fairer and more sustainable society.,501,51110,201505
People want to work and the Green Party believes in helping make that happen.,701,51110,201505
"We also believe everyone should be properly paid for the work they do, ending working poverty and the job insecurity that has people lining up outside food banks and left at the mercy of payday lenders.",701,51110,201505
"We don’t just need jobs, we need more worthwhile secure jobs.",701,51110,201505
"Under the Coalition, 1 million jobs have been lost from the public sector – from the NHS, from schools and colleges, from local government, from the institutions that bind us together, from front-line services.",606,51110,201505
We will put them back.,606,51110,201505
The Coalition claims to have created 2.5 million jobs in the private sector to compensate.,305,51110,201505
"But: Many job-market casualties have turned to self-employment, where life can be precarious and salaries low (there has been a 20% fall in the salaries of the self-employed since 2007, compared with a 6% fall in employee earnings);",701,51110,201505
15% of the workforce is self-employed.,701,51110,201505
"For some this is by choice, for others it is because they can’t get better work;",701,51110,201505
"Many new jobs are insecure, poorly paid and with contracts that fail to balance the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees;",701,51110,201505
"The young in particular suffer, with one in three young workers now on low pay;",701,51110,201505

"Green councillors support the living wage... In Lewisham, Norwich, Lancashire, Camden, Worcester, Stroud and Brighton & Hove, minority Green councillors successfully campaigned for a living wage to help tackle poverty.",412,51110,201505
We will: Increase the minimum wage so that it is a living wage.,412,51110,201505
We propose a minimum wage target for everyone who is working in the UK of £10 per hour by 2020.,412,51110,201505
"In 2015 this would mean a minimum wage of £8.10 an hour generally (and £9.40 in London), saving £2.4 billion a year in tax credits and generating an additional £1.5 billion a year in income tax and National Insurance.",412,51110,201505

Greens in power carry out our policies,305,51110,201505
"The Green-led administration in Brighton cut the chief executive’s salary and raised the pay of the lowest grades, bringing the ratio between the highest and lowest paid Council staff to just over 10:1.",503,51110,201505
The UK finance industry is a disaster area.,416,51110,201505
"Far from generating genuine wealth, its recklessness and greed created the greatest recession since the 1930s, which in turn contributed to the present regime of austerity and cuts to public services.",416,51110,201505
"It has presided over other failures, from the mis-selling of endowment mortgages and payment protection insurance, to the appallingly low returns and high charges of the state-subsidised private pensions industry,",416,51110,201505
its failure to mobilise long-term finance for renewable energy,416,51110,201505
and its collusion in and creation of a whole industry of tax avoidance and evasion.,416,51110,201505
"Meanwhile, those who work in the industry at senior level show no signs of remorse and continue to pocket huge salaries and bonuses.",416,51110,201505
Finance needs root and branch reform.,416,51110,201505
"We would: Move towards creating all national currency through a national monetary authority, answerable to Parliament.",416,51110,201505
The power to create money must be taken out of the hands of private banks.,416,51110,201505
Detailed proposals are set out in the ‘Regaining control of our money’ box.,416,51110,201505
Separate retail and investment banking.,403,51110,201505
Retail banks should be required to limit their role to taking deposits and making loans that facilitate economic activity;,403,51110,201505
investment banks should take the form of partnerships rather than limited companies.,403,51110,201505
Introduce controls on bank lending.,403,51110,201505
Act to control payday lenders and offer alternatives (see the ‘Greens in power’ credit union box).,403,51110,201505
"We will use the government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland to create a network of local banks for every city and region, ensuring that each bank is a People’s Bank, obliged to offer cheap basic banking services.",403,51110,201505
"Invest £2 billion in a network of community banks, mutually owned and serving local areas or particular groups.",408,51110,201505
"Expand the role and the funds of the Green Investment Bank by offering green Individual Savings Accounts and pensions, allowing the bank to borrow and boosting the equity in the bank by £9 billion over the Parliament.",501,51110,201505
Introduce a Robin Hood tax (a financial transaction tax) to reduce destabilising speculation (see the ‘Taxes’ section below for details).,403,51110,201505
Work for the abolition of the City of London Corporation and the special statuses it enjoys.,408,51110,201505
Greens in power carry out our policies,305,51110,201505
"The Green-led administration in Brighton invested £100,000 in a local credit union, partly to help it set up an online system for residents to access loans, making the credit union as accessible as high-interest payday lenders.",403,51110,201505
It also banned such lenders from advertising on Council billboards.,403,51110,201505
"In 2013 Green MP Caroline Lucas worked with East Sussex Credit Union to show ministers how to help credit unions fulfil their potential by, for example, ending the restrictions that put them at a competitive disadvantage when compared with banks.",403,51110,201505
Regaining control of our money One of the most fundamental tasks of government is maintenance of the currency.,412,51110,201505
Without stable money accepted by all we can’t buy and sell things or plan for the future.,408,51110,201505
Inflation in particular makes it hard to take the long-term view that the environmental crisis demands.,501,51110,201505
Most people believe that our money is currently created by the nationalised Bank of England.,408,51110,201505
It isn’t.,408,51110,201505
A pound in your bank account is no more than a promise by the bank to pay you that pound; you don’t actually own any publicly created money.,403,51110,201505
"In fact, commercial banks create new money (in the sense of money in bank accounts) whenever they make loans, and that money disappears when the loan is paid back.",403,51110,201505
The fact that the size of our money supply – the total amount of money in circulation – is dependent upon millions of separate commercial lending decisions by banks makes it hard to maintain economic stability.,403,51110,201505
"During the great recession of the past few years, the unwillingness of banks to make new loans and the desire of people to pay down their debts has meant that the money supply has shrunk, and the government has had to resort to the emergency policy of printing money (called ‘quantitative easing’) to prevent an even worse slump.",403,51110,201505
We believe that the time has come to recognise that the creation of currency and the control of the money supply is far too important to be left to profit-seeking private sector banks and should be brought back under the democratic control of the state.,413,51110,201505
Quantitative easing was but a first step.,403,51110,201505
"Commercial banks should be no more than the custodians of publicly created money in current accounts, and the creation of that money should become the function of a new monetary authority, independent of day-today government control.",403,51110,201505
"This policy would protect ordinary bank accounts, and allow banks to fail safely",403,51110,201505
separate ordinary and investment business,403,51110,201505
provide some control on overall lending and debt,403,51110,201505
"This would be a massive and complex change to our banking system, with many ramifications, and its implementation, involving many years of consultation, legislation and the creation of transitional arrangements, would not be appropriate for one Parliament.",403,51110,201505
"But we would take the first steps of preparing detailed proposals and consulting upon them, and Green MPs will press this issue in the next Parliament.",403,51110,201505
"The change to the new system would create a new and substantial cash flow for the government, which could be spent on social and environmental priorities",416,51110,201505
and assist in paying down the national debt.,414,51110,201505
"Most economic activity takes place in limited companies, many of them vast multinational organisations.",403,51110,201505
"The way they are run has a huge effect on our lives, yet their workers, customers and suppliers have no say in them.",403,51110,201505
"Even shareholders are often remote, and their connection with a company, and responsibility for what it has done, can be severed overnight by the simple act of selling their shares.",403,51110,201505
"The economy would be better, more stable and more responsive if there was (a) much greater diversity of economic models and",403,51110,201505
(b) more control by those most directly involved in some of the economic organisations we already have.,403,51110,201505
"We would: Encourage small firms, which are more embedded in their local communities and provide less opportunity for creating huge disparities of income and wealth.",403,51110,201505
Amend company law to ensure that medium and large companies take account of and report on the environmental and social impact of their activities.,416,51110,201505
Amend company law to ensure that medium and large companies have employee and consumer representatives on their boards.,403,51110,201505
Ensure that Companies House actually collects data due from companies and has accurate data on their beneficial ownership.,403,51110,201505
Set local authorities free to run local enterprises for their own communities.,403,51110,201505
Support social enterprise.,403,51110,201505
"Introduce a cooperative development fund managed by community banks to finance new and expanding cooperatives, alongside a much more comprehensive nationwide network of cooperative development bodies providing the necessary education, training and legal support.",403,51110,201505
Grant employees the legal right in certain circumstances to buy out their companies (funded by the Green Investment Bank) and turn them into workers’ cooperatives;,403,51110,201505
"or, for example, grant the right to turn sporting clubs, in particular football clubs, into community and supporter cooperatives by giving powers for season ticket holders backed by the local community to take over the running of a club.",403,51110,201505
"Expand cooperative education, teaching young people the history of cooperatives as well as how to set them up in practice//.",503,51110,201505
We will ensure business qualifications will give the same emphasis to cooperative and mutual business models as to other private enterprises.,503,51110,201505
The UK economy needs to be more local.,501,51110,201505
Transporting basic foodstuffs all over the planet when they can be grown and sold near to home adds to greenhouse gas emissions and reduces security of supply.,501,51110,201505
"Local businesses are more responsive to local communities and are often better employers than remote, large ones.",403,51110,201505
Income differences are smaller in small firms.,503,51110,201505
"If poorer people are better off, they tend to spend their extra income locally.",403,51110,201505
"So Greens champion small businesses and the local economy, and our Green MP Caroline Lucas was an official Parliamentary champion of the Federation of Small Businesses.",403,51110,201505
We will: Make it easier for small businesses to employ people and contribute towards paying the living wage by using receipts from a wealth tax to reduce employers’ National Insurance in the longer run to 8%.,403,51110,201505
"Improve the competitive position of small firms, maintaining corporation tax for small firms at 20% while raising that for larger firms to 30%.",403,51110,201505
"Increase access to finance by investing £2 billion in a network of community banks, mutually owned and serving local areas or particular groups.",403,51110,201505
"Reduce the tax on conviviality and help small businesses in the tourism and restaurant businesses by lowering VAT to the reduced rate (5%) for cooked food, entertainment and accommodation, costing £6 billion a year.",403,51110,201505
Keep trade local by allowing local authorities to favour local procurement to help their local economy.,403,51110,201505
Ensure that legislation requiring that small businesses should be paid on time is properly enforced.,403,51110,201505
"In the longer run, simplify PAYE through our Basic Income proposals.",403,51110,201505
"Encourage greater diversity among entrepreneurs, including young people, women, ex-service people, the previously unemployed, people who are disabled and older people.",503,51110,201505
"Ensure that the great majority of honest small businesses can compete fairly with the less scrupulous by cracking down on tax evasion, especially in the informal economy and through non-payment of VAT.",403,51110,201505
Give BT and other public telecommunications operators an obligation to provide affordable high-speed broadband-capable infrastructure to every small business.,403,51110,201505
Green MEP lobbies for VAT exemption for small firms,403,51110,201505
Molly Scott Cato MEP has been lobbying in Europe for VAT exemption for micro-businesses.,403,51110,201505
`This follows new European VAT rules on digital products sold in the EU making VAT chargeable in the place of purchase rather than in the place of supply.,110,51110,201505
Microbusinesses are now therefore obliged to collect VAT from up to 28 different EU states at 75 different rates.,110,51110,201505
"Rules designed to ensure that corporations pay fair taxes have entangled many tiny enterprises, and the complexity of administration involved is putting them at risk.",403,51110,201505
"Molly has called for a VAT exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than €100,000 across the whole of Europe.",403,51110,201505
Many micro-businesses have welcomed her intervention;,403,51110,201505
small businesses are responsible for around 80% of jobs across the EU.,403,51110,201505
Tax is not a punishment and it is not stealing by the state.,503,51110,201505
"It is our money, spent on our behalf by the government we elect.",503,51110,201505
Tax redistributes wealth and pays for services that are important to us all.,503,51110,201505
"There are services we share but don’t always use, such as roads, healthcare and schools.",503,51110,201505
"We don’t all drive, we don’t all go to the doctor and we don’t all have children.",503,51110,201505
But we know these things are important for our common life: sharing these things binds us together.,606,51110,201505
Taxation pays for them.,503,51110,201505
"And, to be fair, taxation needs to be progressive, taking proportionately more from those most able to pay.",503,51110,201505
"What should we spend, and on what?",606,51110,201505
"How much should we decide together to spend on the common good, and how much should be left for individuals to spend for themselves?",606,51110,201505
"The pressure in the UK in recent years from the main three parties has been for the state to tax less and spend less, culminating in the dismantling of public services in the name of austerity.",606,51110,201505
"But we need to put this in a wider context, in both space and time.",606,51110,201505
Different countries spend different amounts of their national income on public goods.,606,51110,201505
"The table below compares the Green Party plan, set out in this manifesto, of 45% of GDP spent on public goods with other European countries and the USA, and with the planned decline in investment in the public sphere in the UK.",606,51110,201505
"Every percentage drop represents an assault on the ties that bind us together,",606,51110,201505
on support for those who most need it,503,51110,201505
"and on investment in a democratic, just and sustainable economy.",202,51110,201505
"And the level of spending on the common good has changed over time, responding to changing circumstances.",606,51110,201505
"In 1900, UK government spending was just 14% of GDP.",606,51110,201505
Much of that was defence; there was no welfare state.,105,51110,201505
"Spending climbed to 57% in 1918, the last year of the First World War.",606,51110,201505
"During the inter-war years spending fell back to around 27%, only to climb to a new peak of 70% at the end of the Second World War.",606,51110,201505
"With the creation of the welfare state, spending fell back less after the Second World War, and has moved between 38% and 46% in the past 20 years.",606,51110,201505
What do the cuts mean?,606,51110,201505
"After George Osborne’s 2014 Autumn statement, the Director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies asked ‘How will these cuts be implemented?",0,51110,201505
Is this a fundamental reimagining of the role of the state?’,606,51110,201505
The answer is yes.,606,51110,201505
The Coalition used to say that it was cutting out of necessity.,606,51110,201505
"But this pretence was dropped in 2013 when David Cameron admitted that his commitment to cuts was ideological and permanent: ‘We are sticking to the task... this... means building a leaner, more efficient state.",606,51110,201505
We need to do more with less.,606,51110,201505
"Not just now, but permanently.’",606,51110,201505
"Now we know what this means: more for the rich, less for the poor.",606,51110,201505
There are three reasons for a fundamental shift to increased taxation and spending:,606,51110,201505
"To reverse the politically inspired, damaging and unnecessary cuts in public services we have faced in recent years;",606,51110,201505
To improve these services in key areas such as early education and social care for older people;,504,51110,201505
To meet the challenge of building an entirely new sustainable economy in a world where the private incentives of the market are simply not up to the job.,416,51110,201505
Almost half our income for the common good?,606,51110,201505
That’s what sustainability and equity require.,606,51110,201505
"So the first purpose of taxation is to pay for the things we do in common, and to redistribute income and wealth between us.",606,51110,201505
But there is a second purpose.,606,51110,201505
Taxing something discourages us from buying or doing it.,606,51110,201505
Tax on tobacco reduces smoking.,606,51110,201505
Exempting the tax on something encourages us.,606,51110,201505
The exemption of aviation from fuel taxes was instituted long ago in the early days of flying to encourage aviation.,606,51110,201505
We need to use taxation to encourage sustainability and discourage unsustainability.,416,51110,201505
"Finally, for a tax system to be seen to be fair, everyone must pay their tax.",503,51110,201505
"The tax gap – that is, tax that is illegally evaded, legally avoided by exploiting loopholes, or for which collection is abandoned – is estimated to amount to more than £120 billion a year.",503,51110,201505
"That’s more than the deficit, expected to be £75 billion in 2015.",503,51110,201505
"It’s more than 30 times the total of benefit fraud, and twice the net cost of a Basic Income scheme.",503,51110,201505
"The Green Party is the only party with the political will to make the system fair,",503,51110,201505
to collect unpaid taxes and to challenge powerful tax dodging both in the grey economy and by huge corporations.,403,51110,201505
"Recent governments can’t be serious about collecting tax fairly and efficiently when HMRC staff have been cut from 93,000 in 2004 to just 52,000 in 2015.",305,51110,201505
"Tax dodging Caroline Lucas MP secured a debate with the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke) in order to champion a Fair Tax Mark, much like the Fair Trade Mark, to be awarded to companies that take their tax responsibilities seriously.",403,51110,201505
"Meanwhile, in Europe, Molly Scott Cato MEP worked with other Greens on the European Parliament’s Economics Committee to ensure that there will be a full parliamentary inquiry into the scandal of corporate tax avoidance, ensuring that multinational companies will pay the taxes governments need to pay for infrastructure and public services.",403,51110,201505
"Also, as a member of the European Parliament’s tax working group, Molly Scott Cato is working to achieve an end to the exemption of aviation fuel from taxation.",501,51110,201505
Green MPs will lead on bringing a Tax Dodging Bill before the next Parliament.,503,51110,201505
"That’s the Green Party’s tax policy in a nutshell: tax for fairness and to redistribute income and wealth,",503,51110,201505
and tax for sustainability.,501,51110,201505
To make taxation fairer we would: Introduce a wealth tax of 2% a year on the top 1% (see the ‘Wealth tax’ box) to raise about £25 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.,503,51110,201505
We accept that such a tax would need to be phased in gradually and that the potential yield is uncertain.,503,51110,201505
"We would tie the yield on the wealth tax to our proposals to lower employers’ National Insurance (see below); to the extent that revenues from the wealth tax grow, employers’ National Insurance will be reduced.",503,51110,201505
Get serious about collecting tax.,503,51110,201505
"We would steadily increase staff in HMRC by 15,000 per annum over the Parliament, in particular reopening local offices.",303,51110,201505
"This would cost successively an additional £1 billion each year and is estimated to bring in cumulatively each year an additional £6 billion, still only one-quarter closing the tax gap, and collecting an extra £30 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.",503,51110,201505
"Introduce an urgent programme of legislation, starting with a Tax Dodging Bill designed to reduce the tax gap and establish a general anti-avoidance principle.",503,51110,201505
"Our plans include obliging banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC, and abolishing the rule that allows non-domiciled residents not to pay tax on foreign income.",403,51110,201505
"Consider making the £2 billion industry of designing, promoting and selling tax avoidance schemes illegal.",403,51110,201505
"Introduce a Robin Hood tax of 0.1% on transactions in bonds and equities and 0.01% on derivatives, replacing the existing stamp duty on share transactions.",503,51110,201505
This would raise up to £20 billion a year later in the Parliament and would help stabilise financial markets.,403,51110,201505
"Reform Council Tax by asking people in bigger homes to pay more and those in smaller ones less, and adding two additional bands at the top for the biggest homes worth more than around £2 million and £4.5 million.",503,51110,201505
"Under these proposals two-thirds of people would pay less, with the more substantial increases for those in homes worth more than £1 million.",503,51110,201505
Overall this would be revenue neutral.,503,51110,201505
"Make preparations to replace both Council Tax and the Uniform Business Rate by a system of Land Value Tax, where the level of taxation depends on the rental value of the land concerned.",503,51110,201505
"The rates would be decided locally with no caps, and subject to a degree of equalisation between richer and poorer areas, and would be kept and spent locally.",503,51110,201505
"Transition to Land Value Tax could begin by the last year of the Parliament, and then extend over the following 10 years.",503,51110,201505
Further details are in the ‘Land Value Tax’ box.,503,51110,201505
Abolish the employees’ National Insurance upper threshold.,503,51110,201505
"This would raise £28 billion a year in a full year from those on higher incomes above £42,380, but we would phase this increase in, with the first half of it in 2016–17.",503,51110,201505
Raise the additional (top) rate of income tax to 60%.,503,51110,201505
This will help bring down the maximum salary ratio in any workplace from the best paid to the lowest paid to no more than 10:1 and also act as a disincentive to paying excessive salaries.,503,51110,201505
It would raise approximately £2 billion a year.,503,51110,201505
"Not allow corporation tax relief on any part of a salary that exceeds the maximum allowed by the 10:1 ratio in that company, to make it harder for companies to pay excessive salaries.",503,51110,201505
"Increase corporation tax from 20% to 30%, yielding around £12 billion a year in a full year.",503,51110,201505
Small firms would remain on 20%.,403,51110,201505
"Abolish the capital gains tax personal allowance, raising around £3.8 billion a year.",503,51110,201505
Fundamentally reform inheritance tax and turn it into an accessions tax.,503,51110,201505
"At present, inheritance tax is one of the easiest taxes to both avoid and evade, and the very rich usually find ways of paying very little.",503,51110,201505
"We would make the level of the tax depend on the wealth of the recipient, not the donor, so that all bequests to individual recipients who have less than £200,000 would be tax free.",503,51110,201505
This would encourage people to spread their wealth more widely.,503,51110,201505
"Counter avoidance by abolishing the seven-year rule and making all gifts by living donors subject to a similar accessions tax, with exemptions for small annual amounts as at present.",503,51110,201505
In addition we would tighten up the tax treatment of certain trusts widely used for inheritance tax purposes.,503,51110,201505
A wealth tax Most of the emphasis on inequality is about inequality of income.,503,51110,201505
"But there is even more inequality in the ownership of accumulated wealth – property, pension rights, stocks and shares, and other assets.",503,51110,201505
"The top 10% of households hold nearly half the UK’s wealth, the top 1% hold at least 12.5%.",503,51110,201505
"Many other countries – France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway for example – levy annual wealth taxes of up to 2%.",503,51110,201505
"The Green Party is part of a movement to build a global wealth tax, the only sure way to counter avoidance and evasion of such taxes",503,51110,201505
The introduction of automatic information exchange for income tax purposes from 2016 from tax havens will make it easier to trace hidden wealth.,503,51110,201505
We would introduce a tax of 2% a year on the 1% of the population whose wealth exceeds £3 million.,503,51110,201505
There will be an exemption for farmers with agricultural land worth less than £10 million.,503,51110,201505
"For those with little income and a rather illiquid asset such as a house, arrangements could be made to defer the tax until the sale of the house.",503,51110,201505
In a full year this tax could raise £25 billion.,503,51110,201505
To tax for sustainability we would commit the UK economy to a long-run plan to reduce the use of natural resources through the introduction of resource and pollution taxation.,501,51110,201505
In particular we would: Begin a major ecological shift in the taxation of companies by removing disincentives to employ people.,501,51110,201505
Specifically we would reduce employers’ National Insurance contributions by the same amount as the yield from the wealth tax above.,501,51110,201505
"In the long run this will remove £25 billion a year from a tax on jobs, enabling the tax to be reduced from 13.8% of pay to around 8%.",503,51110,201505
"Reintroduce the fuel duty escalator, raising £2.2 billion in 2015 and an additional £2.2 billion in each successive year through the Parliament.",501,51110,201505
"Put aviation on a level playing field with other modes of transport by making it subject to fuel duty and VAT, raising £16 billion in a full year.",501,51110,201505
"If outdated international law makes this impossible, introduce a flight tax dependent on distance and aircraft type that has the same overall economic effect.",501,51110,201505
"Reduce VAT on housing renovation and repair work (including insulation) to 5%, costing £1.6 billion a year.",501,51110,201505
At present there is no VAT on constructing new dwellings but VAT at 20% on converting and renovating old buildings to be used as homes.,501,51110,201505
"Reduce VAT on the tourism industry (meals and drinks out, accommodation and also live performances) to 5%, putting the UK on a level playing field with our international competitors and costing around £6 billion a year.",403,51110,201505
"Tax plastic bags and unnecessary packaging, raising perhaps £1 billion by 2020.",501,51110,201505
"Levy eco-taxes on non-renewables or pollutants, in particular pesticides, organo-chlorines, nitrogen and artificial fertilisers and phosphates, raising £1 billion by 2020.",501,51110,201505
"Introduce new taxes on the use of water by businesses and on waste heat from power stations, raising £3 billion by 2020.",501,51110,201505
Increase alcohol and tobacco duties by a successive £1.4 billion every year in the Parliament.,416,51110,201505
"Land Value Tax Land Value Tax is a system of local taxation where the landowner pays a proportion of the rental value of the land itself, but not of buildings or improvements upon it, in tax each year.",503,51110,201505
"It has many advantages: It taxes the value of land and rents, which derive from nature and the efforts of the wider community and not from any effort by the landowner, rather than taxing wages and profits, which derive from labour and capital;",503,51110,201505
It is hard to avoid because land cannot be hidden or moved;,503,51110,201505
It dampens speculation in land and land hoarding;,503,51110,201505
"It favours tenants in particular, since the tax cannot be passed on from the landowner, and would substitute for Council Tax, which tenants have to pay;",503,51110,201505
and It discourages landowners from not using derelict or vacant land.,503,51110,201505
The land would be valued at the value that could be obtained if sold for the current planning permitted use.,503,51110,201505
"Commons, urban open space, some nature reserves and land used in common such as roads would be exempt.",501,51110,201505
The rate would be set by the local authority.,503,51110,201505
Special arrangements would allow those with land but a low income to pay their Land Value Tax upon the sale of their land or upon their death.,503,51110,201505
A Land Value Tax set at around 2% of total land values would raise about the same amount as Council Tax and Uniform Business Rate combined.,503,51110,201505
"Moreover, 83% of properties would attract lower bills for Land Value Tax than for Council Tax (and many of these would be paid by the freeholder rather than the tenant).",503,51110,201505
Joining up the policies So what does taxation have to do with equality and sustainability?,503,51110,201505
"It can be used to promote both, rather than promote things we don’t want.",503,51110,201505
"It’s folly to give capital allowances to investment in coal-fired generation,",501,51110,201505
or VAT concessions to new buildings rather than reusing old ones.,501,51110,201505
"It’s unjust to spend billions on tax relief on pension contributions used overwhelmingly by the rich,",503,51110,201505
or not to use inheritance tax to encourage people to spread their wealth.,503,51110,201505
Taxation is not just a matter of getting in the money for the common good; we can use it to shape behaviour.,503,51110,201505
,503,51110,201505
"Imagine a tax and benefit system so simple that we could all depend on a small basic income depending on our age, and then, when we did paid work, we simply got taxed at a higher rate the more we earned...",503,51110,201505
"In the world of the current government, social security means exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin.",504,51110,201505
"Living on benefits is to experience constant insecurity, wondering if payments will stretch to cover today’s food, next week’s school bus, next month’s electricity bill.",504,51110,201505
"It’s to experience discrimination, as society is divided into strivers and scroungers, the deserving and the undeserving poor, taxpayers and those on benefits",503,51110,201505
"It’s to be subject to delayed payments and sanctions, which push you to the food banks.",505,51110,201505
It’s to lose up to four weeks’ payments simply for missing an interview.,504,51110,201505
"Worst of all, the benefits system takes no account of people’s real lives.",504,51110,201505
You can pay more in transport costs to attend compulsory sessions at the Job Centre than you receive in benefits.,504,51110,201505
"All the while, more and more people fall through the cracks in a social security system that, thanks to ideology and incompetence, offers no security.",504,51110,201505
Being on benefits creates a poverty trap that discourages employment or increased hours of work.,504,51110,201505
Yet work in today’s UK doesn’t pay either.,701,51110,201505
"It’s why, for the first time, there are more people living below the poverty line in working families (6.7 million) than in workless and retired families combined (6.3 million).",701,51110,201505
It’s why one of modern UK’s growth industries is payday loan sharking.,701,51110,201505
And it’s one of the reasons why nothing short of a Green revolution in how we think about social security will do.,501,51110,201505
"The Coalition government has introduced more work-for-benefits schemes, tougher rules on claiming benefits and more sanctions.",504,51110,201505
Job Centre staff are encouraged to do whatever it takes to get people off the dole and deny them the money to which they are entitled.,504,51110,201505
"Employment and Support Allowance is a disgrace, with harsh, inaccurate fitness-for-work assessments that are frequently overturned on appeal.",504,51110,201505
Claimants suffer because of huge delays in assessment of Personal Independence Payments.,504,51110,201505
"The Coalition’s flagship policy, a so-called simplification of the system, Universal Credit, is a disaster waiting to happen.",504,51110,201505
Implementation dates are constantly revised and the computer systems are never quite ready.,504,51110,201505
"Although Universal Credit claims to improve incentives to work, if you earn an extra £100, £65 will be deducted from your benefit.",504,51110,201505
"This is higher than the 45% tax charged on incomes over £150,000, yet we are told that, if we increase that top rate, high earners will lack incentives to work or will leave the country.",503,51110,201505
So should we be surprised if many on benefits decide not to work?,503,51110,201505
"In a sensible world, we’d have much lower deductions from earnings for those who earn least.",503,51110,201505
"Instead of entrenching the difference between being in and out of work, which is what mainstream welfare tries to do, the Green Party will work to eliminate it altogether.",503,51110,201505
"Green MP Caroline Lucas and welfare reform In the last Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas took a stand against the removal of the link between benefit levels and inflation,",504,51110,201505
"the government’s welfare reforms,",504,51110,201505
"the widespread scapegoating of the poor and disabled,",503,51110,201505
and the myth that welfare and other public spending was the cause of the economic recession.,504,51110,201505
"Here are some of her comments: ‘As well as being callous and cruel, the bedroom tax is counter-productive.’",503,51110,201505
"‘If our priority is fairness, we should be seeking savings from those who can afford it, not penalising the poorest and pushing them into ever more precarious misery.’",503,51110,201505
‘The government’s misguided austerity programme is leading to social devastation and is economically illiterate.’,503,51110,201505
The Green Party thinks the time has come to reconsider the whole tax and benefits system and to rebuild it from the ground up,503,51110,201505
"– a system not built on punishing and isolating people, making them jump through hoops to get hand-outs from the state, but one that goes back to the founding principles of the welfare state,",503,51110,201505
"in the belief that, as members of society, we have a shared responsibility for one another’s well-being in times of need",606,51110,201505
and a shared commitment to helping others play the most active role they can in our society.,606,51110,201505
The idea in a nutshell is this.,606,51110,201505
Scrap most of the existing benefits apart from disability benefits and Housing Benefit.,503,51110,201505
Abolish the income tax personal allowance.,503,51110,201505
"Then pay every woman, man and child legally resident in the UK a guaranteed, non-means-tested income, sufficient to cover basic needs – a Basic Income.",504,51110,201505
"For those who earn, the Basic Income compensates for the loss of the personal allowance.",503,51110,201505
"Children will receive a reduced Basic Income, Child Benefit.",504,51110,201505
"Pensioners will receive their Basic Income at a higher level, as a Citizen’s Pension.",504,51110,201505
The advantages are many and we support the principle of a Universal Basic Income because it has the potential to: Act as a springboard rather than a safety net;,503,51110,201505
people can take jobs without fear of prosecution for working while on benefits;,503,51110,201505
Prevent people falling into absolute poverty rather than trying to help them when they are already there;,503,51110,201505
"Reward people for all the work that’s done outside the formal economy, and most of this work is done by women;",503,51110,201505
"Encourage more of this unpaid activity, much of which – such as food growing, fixing things that have gone wrong, converting older buildings, protecting the natural environment – is a vital part of a transition to a more sustainable economy;",501,51110,201505
Avoid the poverty trap in which an increase in wages leads to a massive loss of benefits;,503,51110,201505
"Make everyone who earns, however little, a citizen who contributes to society by paying taxes, giving almost everyone a stake – raising the personal allowance takes us in precisely the wrong direction;",606,51110,201505
Be simple to administer and easy to understand.,303,51110,201505
Basic Income would be a massive change to the entire UK tax and benefits system.,503,51110,201505
We recognise that it would not be practicable or right to carry out that change within a single Parliament.,305,51110,201505
We are publishing alongside but separate from this manifesto a detailed set of proposals for a comprehensive Basic Income scheme.,504,51110,201505
"It contains full details of the scheme itself, costings and proposals on how to pay for it, and an initial analysis of how the scheme would affect the net income of different groups.",503,51110,201505
"We would use the forthcoming Parliament to Consult upon this scheme,",305,51110,201505
"Have government departments carry out and commission research (including research into behavioural changes and how Basic Income would affect those on the lowest incomes and child poverty), and Draft appropriate legislation, with a view to implementing the full scheme in the following Parliament.",503,51110,201505
There are further things we would propose to do in the forthcoming Parliament as steps towards this major reform:,503,51110,201505
Reform the existing working-age benefits regime.,504,51110,201505
Pay an enhanced Child Benefit.,504,51110,201505
Introduce a universal Citizen’s Pension.,504,51110,201505
A major problem with existing working-age benefits and tax credits is the poverty trap.,504,51110,201505
We would be prepared to invest up to £30billion over the Parliament to reduce the amounts that people lose from their benefits when they move into paid work and to fund the other changes to the benefits regime set out in this section.,504,51110,201505
"In complex ways, eligibility for some benefits (e.g. Jobseeker’s Allowance) is lost altogether once a person is employed for a certain period, or reduced pound for pound if certain small disregarded amounts are exceeded.",504,51110,201505
"Some other benefits (e.g. Housing Benefit) are reduced in a different way, by withdrawal rates that allow those earning to keep a small part of what they earn and not lose all of it.",504,51110,201505
"We would make small changes in the direction of allowing those who earn some income from paid work to keep more of that income, starting with increasing the disregards for Income Support and Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA).",504,51110,201505
"Initially we would increase the income disregarded on JSA for all categories of client to £50 a week,",504,51110,201505
with similar increases for those on Universal Credit.,504,51110,201505
It is not possible to be precise about how much the increased costs of such moves would be offset by more people on benefits taking up employment or working for longer hours.,504,51110,201505
"Depending on results, we are prepared to invest up to £30 billion on such employment-stimulating measures over the Parliament.",504,51110,201505
"We would also explore the introduction of a more generous treatment of earnings within Universal Credit for all claimants, whatever their housing circumstances.",504,51110,201505
"We would also: Halt implementation of the Universal Credit programme and carry out a thorough review of its structure and implementation, including the treatment of earned income, and removing conditionality.",504,51110,201505
"End work-for-benefits programmes, or workfare, and ensure a fair choice of waged work opportunities or voluntary training for jobseekers.",504,51110,201505
Ensure that all those on training or work placements as part of the benefits regime are either in college-based training or at work earning at least the minimum wage.,504,51110,201505
Review the harsh systems of sanctions and benefits caps introduced by the Coalition government and its predecessors.,504,51110,201505
Consider offering more personalised job-seeking support for people with mental health problems.,503,51110,201505
"Restore Council Tax Benefit at the equivalent of 2012–13 levels for low-income householders, costing around £500 million a year.",503,51110,201505
Cancel the Department for Work and Pensions contracts with the private sector for benefit entitlement assessment.,504,51110,201505
"Restore the link between state benefits and earnings; ensure state benefits rise as fast as prices or wages, whichever of those grows more.",504,51110,201505
Abolish childcare tax credits and tax reliefs in the light of our proposals for free universal early education and childcare.,504,51110,201505
Pay students maintenance grants until Basic Income is introduced.,506,51110,201505
"Raise the minimum wage and outlaw exploitative zero-hours contracts, so that the jobs taken by unemployed people are above a minimum standard.",412,51110,201505
Bringing up a child is expensive.,606,51110,201505
It is also vital work on behalf of society as a whole; those of us without children will depend on the children of others when we grow older.,606,51110,201505
"It is right that society as a whole makes a contribution, as is recognised by our free state education system.",606,51110,201505
"But that system needs two extensions: a free universal early education and childcare service (see Chapter 7 on Education),",504,51110,201505
and a more realistic level of Child Benefit.,504,51110,201505
We will: Raise Child Benefit as from 2016 from £20.70 a week for the oldest or only child and £13.70 a week for additional children in 2015–16 to £40 a week for each child.,504,51110,201505
Pay for the £15.5 billion net cost of this by using this much of the £28 billion raised from those on higher incomes by abolishing the National Insurance upper threshold.,503,51110,201505
"The bedrock of our pension policy is the Citizen’s Pension, which, unlike the new flat-rate pension, would be paid to all pensioners regardless of contribution record, and to existing as well as new pensioners, so no pensioner will live in poverty.",504,51110,201505
We would introduce this in 2016.,504,51110,201505
"It will pay £180 a week to a single pensioner or £310 for a couple, taking all pensioners above the poverty line.",504,51110,201505
Increases will be at the higher of the increases in the prices of basic goods and services or in average earnings.,504,51110,201505
"The existing State Pension and Pension Credits cost £90 billion a year, while the new pensions above will cost £116 billion.",504,51110,201505
The net cost is therefore £26 billion.,504,51110,201505
"We will fund this by reducing tax and National Insurance incentives for private pensions by onehalf, raising £20 billion (see the ‘Older people and pensions’ section in Chapter 5) and using a further £6 billion available from abolishing the National Insurance upper threshold (see the ‘Child Benefit’ section above).",503,51110,201505
"Joining up the policies So what do housing, pensions and investing in a new sustainable economy have to do with each other?",501,51110,201505
"Pensions need sound, long-run infrastructure to invest in, such as energy generation and social housing.",501,51110,201505
"And, if the pensions system is broken, people will invest in houses instead, pushing up prices and rents.",501,51110,201505
"So, if we create a new pensions system investing in the things we need, and discourage the things such as mortgage interest relief for landlords that encourage investment in housing, 501then we reduce the money chasing existing housing, and prices and rents fall.",501,51110,201505
It’s another virtuous circle.,501,51110,201505
Imagine being part of another kind of coalition.,606,51110,201505
"Not the grubby one that’s handed democracy over to the private sector, but one made up of elected politicians determined to govern for the common good,",606,51110,201505
"a revitalised local government,",301,51110,201505
"a regulated private sector, the third sector and non-profits",403,51110,201505
– and you and me.,606,51110,201505
Imagine a voting system in which your vote actually counts.,202,51110,201505
Imagine more decisions being taken where they really matter – locally.,202,51110,201505
"Imagine going to your reopened public library, strolling round your well-tended local park, taking your child to a school brought back under local authority control, and visiting an elderly relative in a local authority care home staffed by trained and well-paid carers.",606,51110,201505
"Imagine the end of cronyism, corruption and the ‘Westminster bubble’.",304,51110,201505

"We elect politicians to govern in our name, not to hand power over to huge corporations acting in shareholder interest.",202,51110,201505
"Successive governments, and particularly the current one, have outsourced government to the unaccountable private sector.",304,51110,201505
This hollowing out of government is based on dogma – that the private sector does things better than the public sector.,304,51110,201505
Successive scandals and failures of provision have proved this dogma wrong.,304,51110,201505
"But still the contracts get handed out, with the private sector taking all the profit and the taxpayer – you and me – shouldering all the risk.",304,51110,201505
Government has been put out to tender.,304,51110,201505
"Corporate interests, heading a coalition of the rich and powerful, have ruled the roost for too long.",304,51110,201505
This has brought politics and politicians into disrepute.,304,51110,201505
"When things go wrong, the government blames the companies to which it has outsourced its work, and politicians are accused of being on the make.",304,51110,201505
"Some are, as we found out during the expenses scandal.",304,51110,201505
"But many aren’t, and the Green Party will lead a revolution in standards, putting politics back in the hands of the people and governing for the common good.",202,51110,201505
It is well placed to do this.,305,51110,201505
"The Green Party has made electoral gains at local, national and European level.",202,51110,201505
"Our councillors, our MP and our MEPs work effectively for the people who voted for them.",202,51110,201505
"The biggest lesson of the Scottish referendum was that, when people are given the responsibility for making big decisions, they grab it with both hands.",202,51110,201505
The Green Party will turn the tide on apathy and disillusionment by making these opportunities the rule rather than the exception.,202,51110,201505
"A Green government would: Regulate the private sector in the common interest, including curbing excessive pay for executives and senior managers.",202,51110,201505
Introduce a Public Service Users Bill to bring back into public ownership sectors of the economy on which we all depend.,413,51110,201505
"Recognise that, if government is small, society doesn’t automatically become big – the third sector needs strong, enabling government.",202,51110,201505
"Treat citizens as grown-ups, capable of recognising the common good and acting on it.",606,51110,201505
Not accept the dogma that government cannot lead or innovate and has no entrepreneurial drive.,202,51110,201505
We will set creative government free.,202,51110,201505
"Recognise that efficiency in public services does matter, provided it is not at the cost of poor service or exploitation of staff.",303,51110,201505
We would expect to find very modest savings of 0.3% over 50% of the government’s operations each successive year.,303,51110,201505
"In contrast, the Coalition has too often described actual cuts in public services as efficiency savings.",305,51110,201505
Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Public Service Users Bill,413,51110,201505
Her Public Service Users Bill would: Make public ownership the default option before any service is sold off.,413,51110,201505
Ensure people are asked – and genuinely listened to – before any service is put out to tender.,202,51110,201505
Give the public a right to recall private companies if they’re running our services poorly.,202,51110,201505
Make private companies running public services more transparent.,202,51110,201505
UK politics is rooted in the past and has lost touch with the present.,204,51110,201505
Our Parliament looks back to feudal times rather than forward to democratic times;,204,51110,201505
we cling to 18 as the age of political maturity despite young people’s growing sophistication and capacity to make decisions for themselves;,204,51110,201505
we legitimise corruption through unfair funding of political parties;,304,51110,201505
our MPs pay more attention to their parties than to the people when it comes to voting – constituents need to be re-empowered.,204,51110,201505
To put this right the Green Party will: Move towards a written constitution with a Bill of Rights.,204,51110,201505
Bring in proportional representation (PR) using the Additional Member System for parliamentary elections,204,51110,201505
and continue fixedterm Parliaments.,203,51110,201505
"Only the 200,000 votes in marginal seats really counted in the last election – that’s less than 0.5% of those eligible to vote.",202,51110,201505
We would make everyone’s vote count.,202,51110,201505
Introduce the right to vote at 16.,204,51110,201505
Reform the House of Lords to become a fully elected body chosen by PR;,204,51110,201505
"but, to promote its independence, members should be elected for only one fixed term of ten years, with half the House being elected every five years.",204,51110,201505

Retain the principle that human rights are the common property of the whole world by keeping the Human Rights Act,201,51110,201505
and retaining the UK’s membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe.,201,51110,201505
Aspire to a 50:50 Parliament by 2025 with equal numbers of women and men.,202,51110,201505
Introduce referendums on local government decisions if called for by 20% of the local electorate.,202,51110,201505
Introduce recall referendums on MPs and other representatives if 20% of electors request it.,202,51110,201505
Make equality before the law a fundamental constitutional right.,204,51110,201505
But this is only a reality if all can afford to use the law.,202,51110,201505
"We would restore the cuts to Legal Aid, costing around £700 million a year.",202,51110,201505
The Scotland independence referendum put decentralisation back on the political agenda – a cause that Greens have championed for years.,301,51110,201505
We have long argued that nothing should be decided at a central level that can be decided at a local level.,301,51110,201505
"We need to improve the way the UK is governed, passing power back to the people, back to where they live and work.",301,51110,201505
Local councils have been starved of the funds they need to do their job.,301,51110,201505
"That is why requests for social care go unheeded, libraries are shut and public parks neglected.",301,51110,201505
And it isn’t just money.,301,51110,201505
Local democracy is withering and dying because councillors are hemmed about by regulation and their functions have been systematically removed over the past 30 years.,202,51110,201505
Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has virtually abolished onshore wind energy by overriding local planning and halting turbine projects.,301,51110,201505

"allow local councils to conduct revaluations and to set their own multiplier rates, provided they are more progressive,",503,51110,201505
and not require a Council Tax referendum when they do so.,301,51110,201505
Ensure that grant funding is sufficient to pay for all statutory services that councils are required to provide.,301,51110,201505
"To fund discretionary activities, we would allow local authorities to set local business rates, and then distribute the whole of Council Tax receipts and Business Rate receipts between local authorities on a basis decided by a Commission independent of central government set up by local authorities themselves.",301,51110,201505
"Also allow local authorities to levy new local taxes, such as local tourist taxes,",301,51110,201505
"empty homes levies,",301,51110,201505
supermarket taxes,301,51110,201505

"Allow local authorities freedom to set local fines, fees and charges.",301,51110,201505
Put these taxation arrangements beyond future Whitehall revision by giving formal constitutional protection to local democracy and tax-raising powers.,204,51110,201505
Scrap the New Homes Bonus and add the money to the Revenue Support Grant.,503,51110,201505
Not start any new private finance initiative projects,413,51110,201505
"and set local authorities free to borrow to fund local capital investment in social housing, electricity generation and distribution, and local public transport.",301,51110,201505
Set up a fund of up to £5 billion over the Parliament to buy out existing PFI projects where it is a good deal to do so.,413,51110,201505

"Restore local authority control over education, with full delegation of the appropriate budgets.",301,51110,201505
"Allow local authorities to run local public transport and other local services such as domestic and commercial waste disposal, community energy schemes and local food production entirely as they wish,",301,51110,201505

Keep trade local by allowing local authorities to favour local procurement to help their local economy.,301,51110,201505
Give local authorities powers to encourage local live performance in the arts by moving funding from the regional to the local level,301,51110,201505
and modifying regulations so that small-scale live performance in pubs and similar venues is not stifled.,301,51110,201505
"Create an Assembly for Cornwall, with similar powers to the Welsh Assembly.",301,51110,201505
Work for the abolition of the City of London Corporation and the special statuses it enjoys.,202,51110,201505
"Residents will decide on the future governance arrangements for the local functions exercised by the Corporation, with the same division of roles between the local and the strategic as in any other part of London.",202,51110,201505
Planning Require local authorities to set out a local carbon plan showing how their area will meet overall greenhouse gas reduction targets.,501,51110,201505
Put planning back in the hands of local government by: repealing the National Planning Policy Framework,301,51110,201505
and in particular its presumption in favour of economic development;,416,51110,201505
restricting the ability of the Secretary of State to call in planning applications;,301,51110,201505
restricting the right of applicants to appeal only where there has been an error in the planning process;,301,51110,201505

"Support preservation of the historic environment, in part by being flexible about how older buildings reduce their energy use.",501,51110,201505
Constitutional Convention The Green Party supports calls for a Constitutional Convention led by citizens – a People’s Convention.,202,51110,201505
We’d use that opportunity to make the case for the changes detailed above.,204,51110,201505
"Parts of England, based on groups of local authorities, could come together to exercise greater powers; these might amount to existing regions, or possibly city regions.",204,51110,201505
"The process must be driven by the bottom up decisions of local authorities, not by top down direction.",202,51110,201505
"The Convention would also consider further devolution to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.",204,51110,201505
"As set out above, we favour much greater devolution to and tax-raising powers for local authorities, with this settlement put beyond future Whitehall revision by giving formal constitutional protection to local democracy",204,51110,201505
. Any constitutional changes should be subject to referendums.,202,51110,201505
Greens have long supported the process of devolution in Wales.,301,51110,201505
"We believe that the people of Wales should enjoy the degree of autonomy, perhaps including full self-government or independence, that they wish to have, as expressed in a referendum.",301,51110,201505
"Up until any such referendum, Greens in Wales will focus on improving and maximising the potential of the current devolution settlement.",301,51110,201505
"Reflecting the devolved status of Wales within the UK, the Wales Green Party has an autonomous status within the wider party and publishes independent policy statements and its own manifesto covering all areas of devolved power.",301,51110,201505
"These include matters such as health, education, transport and housing.",301,51110,201505
"Greens in Wales would: Increase real power at all levels, from local councils up to the Welsh Assembly.",301,51110,201505
Increase the number of Assembly members.,301,51110,201505
Push for the National Assembly to become a Parliament with powers equal to those in Scotland.,301,51110,201505
One benefit of these increased powers would be the ability for Wales to fully realise its potential as a producer of clean renewable energy.,501,51110,201505
Greens recognise that cultural diversity is as vital as ecological biodiversity in maintaining and enriching a healthy and fair society.,607,51110,201505
"We would promote and protect this cultural diversity at a grassroots level with the promotion of community radio, television, live arts, etc. in both the Welsh and English languages.",607,51110,201505
Wales Green Party policies would help create the strong local sustainable economies and thriving communities necessary for the future of the Welsh language and the nation’s rich cultural diversity.,607,51110,201505
We live in the information age and we know that information is power.,201,51110,201505
But how should information be controlled?,201,51110,201505
"What information should be available, and to whom?",201,51110,201505
"The Green Party supports a world of open, freely flowing information.",201,51110,201505
We don’t want disproportionate or unaccountable surveillance or censorship.,201,51110,201505
"We want a transparent state, but we want control over the data that our digital lives create.",201,51110,201505
We need copyright laws that reward creators but that are consistent with digital technologies.,201,51110,201505
Above all we want democratic political control of this technology,202,51110,201505
We would consider combining elements of the policies below into a comprehensive Digital Bill of Rights.,201,51110,201505
We would: Oppose any case for secret unaccountable mass surveillance of the type exposed by Edward Snowden.,201,51110,201505
We do accept that government law enforcement agencies may occasionally need to intercept communications in specific circumstances.,201,51110,201505
"Such specific surveillance should be proportionate, necessary, effective and within the rule of law, with independent judicial approval and genuine parliamentary oversight.",202,51110,201505
"Replace the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which has failed to regulate the deployment of undercover police;",201,51110,201505

and to enshrine an open and effective right of redress.,201,51110,201505
Support and protect Internet freedom.,201,51110,201505
Follow human rights judgments limiting surveillance and data retention in full.,201,51110,201505
Support the EU’s proposals to strengthen data protection laws against opposition from large US data-driven companies.,108,51110,201505
"Limit the censoring or takedown of content or activity to exceptional circumstances, clearly set out within a comprehensive legal framework.",201,51110,201505
"Make copyright shorter in length, fair and flexible, and prevent patents applying to software.",201,51110,201505
Introduce a more satisfactory law on so-called malicious comments made on social media than the blanket and crude section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.,201,51110,201505
"Oppose the privatisation of data held by the government that should be open to all, such as the Postcode Address File,",201,51110,201505
"or by companies providing public services, such as data on the progress of buses that can be used by Smartphone apps to predict waiting times.",201,51110,201505
"Oppose the sale of personal data, such as health or tax records, for commercial or other ends.",201,51110,201505
Use government purchasing power to support open standards in information technology.,201,51110,201505
How politics is reported is vital for our democracy – active citizenship has to be informed citizenship.,202,51110,201505
Public support for the arts is part of a civilised society.,502,51110,201505
We would: Tighten the rules on cross-media ownership and ensure that no individual or company owns more than 20% of a media market.,403,51110,201505
Support the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics and for the cross-party Royal Charter.,201,51110,201505
But if this is not supported by all the major newspapers we will support legislation to implement the Leveson system of independent press self-regulation.,201,51110,201505
"Maintain the BBC as the primary public service broadcaster, free of government interference, with funding guaranteed in real terms in statute to prevent government interference.",201,51110,201505
Increase government arts funding by £500 million a year to restore the cuts made since 2010,502,51110,201505
"and reinstate proper levels of funding for local authorities, helping to keep local museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open.",502,51110,201505
Reduce VAT to 5% for live performances.,502,51110,201505
Work to support fair pay productions in the arts.,502,51110,201505
Support initiatives to make the arts and sports accessible to all.,502,51110,201505
"Set targets for participation in sports by women, ethnic minorities and disabled people in particular.",503,51110,201505
Make sure all children get at least a half-day equivalent of sports in school,502,51110,201505
and encourage both the use of schools sports facilities by the community,502,51110,201505
and participation in regional and national sporting events by our young people.,502,51110,201505
Ensure that all have digital access and give BT and other public telecommunications operators an obligation to provide affordable high-speed broadband-capable infrastructure to every household,411,51110,201505
and small business.,403,51110,201505
"This in particular will encourage video-conferencing, helping to reduce both business and family travel.",501,51110,201505
Strengthen controls on advertising directed at children.,403,51110,201505
Value the contribution made by civil society organisations both here and abroad.,606,51110,201505
"In particular, we would repeal the Lobbying Act 2014 (see the ‘Green MP opposes the Lobbying Bill’ box below).",201,51110,201505
Support state funding of political parties.,202,51110,201505
Give fair representation to political parties in televised debates.,202,51110,201505
"Caroline Lucas opposes the Lobbying Bill At every stage of the Lobbying Bill’s progress through Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas was at the forefront of attempts to stop the Bill becoming law.",201,51110,201505
She was one of a group of MPs who tabled an amendment to reject the Bill outright and was a vocal critic of moves to drastically curtail the debate we need for a healthy democracy.,202,51110,201505
"Caroline campaigned for legislation that would shine a real light on lobbying activity and criticised the Coalition’s proposals for letting most corporate lobbyists off the hook, at the same time as effectively gagging the activities of civil society groups speaking out on anything from housing policy to wildlife conservation.",201,51110,201505
She tabled an amendment to the Bill that would have opened up to proper scrutiny how much is spent on lobbying,202,51110,201505
– as well as who is doing it.,202,51110,201505
She called for details to be made public about when staff transfer between the civil service and the private sector.,304,51110,201505
And she has stood up in Parliament time and again to reiterate the Green Party’s commitment to repealing what’s dubbed the Gagging Bill.,201,51110,201505
"Imagine being able to leave your car in the garage – or not needing one at all... because reliable, affordable public transport, coupled with safe, clean, welcoming streets for walking and cycling, meets your transport needs.",501,51110,201505
Could that not be the real world?,501,51110,201505
"Like so much else, the UK has got transport upside down.",501,51110,201505
"The big picture is a world of finite resources, especially the type that runs much of our transport – petroleum.",501,51110,201505
"This is running out, and we know we need to leave much of what is left in the ground.",501,51110,201505
We have to create a transport system based on sustainable alternatives.,501,51110,201505
"We also have an increasingly car-dependent population because the cost of public transport has risen faster than wages and faster than the total cost of driving,",501,51110,201505
and in many areas public transport is so scarce that people have little alternative but to get around by car.,501,51110,201505
This has led to a public health crisis caused by rising levels of physical inactivity and health-damaging air pollution.,501,51110,201505
"We also face an increasing toll of death and injury on the roads, particularly among pedestrians and cyclists who face unacceptable danger in our vehicle-dominated and congested towns, cities and villages.",501,51110,201505
"Our privatised railways are fragmented and uncoordinated, ticket prices are high and unpredictable, and timetables do not connect seamlessly with buses at stations.",413,51110,201505
This means rail fails to play its full part in delivering an effective alternative to the private car.,501,51110,201505
Long-distance travel by air is one of the most energy-intensive and polluting forms of transport and causes health-damaging local pollution near airports.,416,51110,201505
"Aviation fuel goes untaxed and there is no VAT on tickets, amounting to a £16 billion a year subsidy in the UK.",416,51110,201505
"We need a shift in priority, removing subsidies from air travel to invest in public transport that supports the common good.",416,51110,201505
"In the long run we have to create a transport system that is socially just and addresses health inequality by prioritising affordable access to services by walking, cycling and public transport,",416,51110,201505
"by reducing road danger,",501,51110,201505
by cleaning up our air,501,51110,201505
and by minimising congestion.,501,51110,201505
"This transport system should use electricity, not oil,",501,51110,201505
"and make our towns, cities and villages into more liveable, socially inclusive places.",501,51110,201505
"Against this backdrop, mainstream transport policy, which urges us to travel further and faster than ever before, is senseless, yet this is what all parties except the Green Party offer you.",416,51110,201505
"The key to getting this right is to manage demand rather than increase it; that is, to reduce the need to travel in the first place.",416,51110,201505
"We need to: Reduce the distances travelled,",501,51110,201505
reduce the number of journeys made by car,501,51110,201505
"and switch as many journeys as possible to walking, cycling and public transport;",501,51110,201505
"Encourage alternatives to travel, such as video-conferencing;",501,51110,201505
Integrate different transport options and provide seamless door–to-door journeys;,501,51110,201505
"Prioritise everyday access for everybody wherever they live to local facilities such as the shops, the doctors’ surgery, schools and workplaces;",501,51110,201505

Green councillors mean safer streets...,501,51110,201505
"Green councillors were instrumental in bringing in 20 mph limits on many residential roads in Norwich, Islington and Leicester, as well as a default 20 mph limit on all residential roads in Lancashire and in Brighton & Hove.",501,51110,201505
"For trains to play their part in the total journey experience, they need to connect seamlessly with buses and convenient walking and cycling routes to local centres of habitation.",413,51110,201505
The Green Party is committed to bringing rail services into public ownership and control.,413,51110,201505
"The current fragmented structure does not put the passenger and the total journey experience at the centre of planning and has created a costly, wasteful, uncoordinated outcome.",413,51110,201505
"Recent experience in running the East Coast Main Line within the public sector has shown that both quality and receipts to the Treasury go up when a rail service is run in this way,",413,51110,201505
"whereas experience on the West Coast Main Line in the private sector shows that the franchise system is costly, wasteful and not fit for purpose.",413,51110,201505
The Green Party will consult widely on the organisational details of a rail operation in public ownership and how it will link to democratic accountability at the regional and city-region geographical scales.,413,51110,201505
Diesel exhaust emissions are a known human carcinogen,501,51110,201505
"and diesel trains do not perform as well as electrified rail operations in terms of passenger comfort, acceleration and deceleration, and the ability to make more stops at intermediate stations with minimal impact on overall journey time.",501,51110,201505
The Green Party wants to see electrification of the railway system to achieve levels to be found in Germany (59% of track electrified) or Sweden (73% electrified).,501,51110,201505
The UK has 34% of its track electrified.,501,51110,201505
"High levels of electrification reduce health-damaging air pollution,",501,51110,201505
reduce greenhouse gases,501,51110,201505
and deliver a much-improved passenger experience.,501,51110,201505
"Electrification will also require new rolling stock and the Green Party will promote the design and manufacturing of this new stock in the UK,",501,51110,201505
contributing to job creation in those regions with higher than average unemployment.,701,51110,201505
"Putting this plan into action for the common good means bringing the railways back into public ownership – making them belong to you and me, run by rail workers for passengers.",413,51110,201505
"On 26 June 2013, Green MP Caroline Lucas published a Private Members’ Bill to do just this, a policy supported by 66% of the British public.",413,51110,201505
The privatised railways cost over £1 billion a year in: Interest payments; Debt write-offs; The costs of railway fragmentation; The profit margins of tiers of contractors and sub-contractors;  Payments to shareholders; and Bonuses paid to railway bosses (up to 166% of annual salaries).,413,51110,201505
"Between 1997 and 2013, rail fares leapt by 22%, while road users have experienced a 9% drop – exactly the wrong priority.",413,51110,201505
Rail isn’t really ‘private’ anyway – 60% of the network is owned by state-backed foreign companies.,413,51110,201505
And this ‘private’ system takes £4 billion in public subsidies every year.,413,51110,201505
Labour’s response is to require the state to bid for franchises it already owns – at millions of pounds a time.,305,51110,201505
"As Caroline says, a privatised railway ‘is a blatant transfer of public money to private interests at the expense of the taxpayer and rail passengers’.",413,51110,201505
Bringing the railways back into public ownership would cost very little if it was done as existing franchises fell due for renewal.,413,51110,201505
This will: Save money;,413,51110,201505
Mean a better deal for passengers;,413,51110,201505

and Reduce congestion and improve safety.,501,51110,201505
"In addition on the railways, we would not support HS2 (the proposed high-speed network).",416,51110,201505
"The money to be spent on this hugely expensive project, which at best will reduce journey times for a few passengers, would be much better spent on improving the conventional rail connections between various major cities,",416,51110,201505
improving the resilience of the existing network to climate change,416,51110,201505
and reopening lines and stations that have been closed.,416,51110,201505
The major challenge for our transport system is to decarbonise it and end its reliance on fossil fuels.,501,51110,201505
"We would: End the wasteful and destructive national major roads programme, saving £15 billion over the Parliament.",416,51110,201505
"Spend part of this £15 billion on improving and subsidising public transport, with an average fare reduction of 10% costing £8 billion over the Parliament,",413,51110,201505
fixing potholes in existing roads,411,51110,201505
and investing in walking and cycling.,501,51110,201505
Support walking and cycling.,501,51110,201505
"In particular, we would ensure that pedestrians and cyclists get their fare share of road space and would spend at least £30 per head on them over every year of the Parliament.",501,51110,201505
"Funding should be allocated flexibly to make safe, convenient routes that address the needs of pedestrians and cyclists while reducing any risk of conflict between them.",501,51110,201505
"Support the re-regulation of bus services to provide a better, more reliable service.",413,51110,201505
End the favourable tax treatment of aviation,416,51110,201505
and have a separate target for aviation emissions of below 37.5 million tonnes CO2 equivalent a year.,501,51110,201505
"Stop airport expansion, in particular no new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick,",416,51110,201505
and ban night flying.,501,51110,201505
"Invest in electric vehicle charging points for buses and taxis, and for cars where there are gaps in the network of public and community transport.",501,51110,201505
Incentivise consolidation of white van deliveries so that last-mile deliveries can be made by cargo bikes and electric vehicles in local areas.,501,51110,201505
"Instead of prestige projects such HS2 and new runways, we need to prioritise local transport and make sure it is accessible to everybody.",416,51110,201505
"The Green Party would: Prioritise affordable local public transport,",413,51110,201505
"accessible to all, including those with disabilities.",503,51110,201505
"Support free local transport for pensioners, including the existing local bus pass scheme and the Freedom Pass in London.",504,51110,201505
"Extend free local public transport to young people and students, costing around £4 billion a year.",504,51110,201505
"Develop regional smart payment systems with integrated ticketing, like the London Oyster system.",501,51110,201505
Extend networks of public transport to include rural areas.,503,51110,201505
The numbers of people killed or seriously injured on the UK’s roads have fallen in recent years.,411,51110,201505
"But they are still appallingly high: 1,713 people died on the roads in 2013, and 21,657 were seriously injured, far worse than for other modes of transport.",411,51110,201505
We will: Work for a road transport system that results in zero deaths or serious injuries by systematically reducing sources of danger on the roads.,411,51110,201505
"Reduce both collisions and fuel use by bringing down speed limits, in particular to 20 mph in residential areas, including main roads where people live, work and shop;",501,51110,201505
enforce speed limits with speed cameras and policing.,501,51110,201505
Change the culture of road justice and civil compensation with a road danger reduction approach.,411,51110,201505
A greater duty of care should be expected of drivers in reducing injury and intimidation of vulnerable road users.,503,51110,201505
Motor vehicle drivers should be presumed liable for injuries to pedestrians and cyclists.,503,51110,201505
"If the casualty has contributed to the collision, compensation may be reduced, but not when the victim is a child, elderly (70+) or impaired.",503,51110,201505
Reduce the alcohol limit for drivers to as close to zero as is practicable.,411,51110,201505
Require newly manufactured lorries to be equipped with best practice technology to make sure that drivers are fully aware of the presence of all pedestrians and cyclists.,411,51110,201505
"Pedestrian and cyclist fatalities and serious injuries when involved in collisions with lorries are predictable, preventable and unacceptable.",411,51110,201505
"The technology already exists and is in use in several countries and consists of a mixture of in-cab screens linked to cameras, multiple wing mirrors and physical modification to prevent people being dragged under the vehicle.",411,51110,201505
Lorries already in use must be retro-fitted with the same equipment and lorries not so equipped will not be allowed into our towns and cities.,411,51110,201505
"Reduce lorry activity and road freight volume by improving rail freight services,",411,51110,201505
"reducing the number of empty or partially loaded trips,",411,51110,201505
and using cargo bikes for last-mile deliveries to replace some white van trips.,411,51110,201505
Towns and cities for people We need to rescue our towns and cities from traffic and turn them back into places where we want to be.,501,51110,201505
The Green Party will support an Active Travel Bill for England in order to achieve this.,501,51110,201505
"Make streets healthy and safe places for people to cycle and walk and for children to play,",501,51110,201505
while building physical activity into their daily journeys.,501,51110,201505
"Help schools and workplaces to support active travel to and from work, and encourage local authorities to assist this by linking their public health and transport functions.",411,51110,201505
Ensure that all planning decisions have to take into account the active travel and public transport implications.,411,51110,201505
Make public transport more convenient by integrating ticketing with smart regional ticketing systems such as the LondonOyster card.,411,51110,201505
Introduce road-pricing schemes such as the London congestion charge and road-user tolls for heavy lorries.,411,51110,201505
Begin consultation with a view to developing a framework for the progressive elimination of diesel exhaust emissions.,501,51110,201505
"A major cause of air pollution is emissions from diesel vehicles (cars, buses and trains).",501,51110,201505
We recognise the latest scientific evidence of the harmful effect of diesel on human health.,501,51110,201505
Introduce Ultra Low Emission Zones to ensure air pollution reduces to comply with EU limits.,501,51110,201505
"Reduce the need for car parking spaces by reducing car dependency and transferring trips, where appropriate, to walking, cycling and public transport.",501,51110,201505
"Car parking is expensive to provide, can obstruct pedestrians and people with disabilities if it takes place on pavements, and takes up valuable road space that could be reallocated to pedestrians and cyclists.",501,51110,201505
"Reduce parking spaces in new developments and increase rates of walking, cycling and public transport by strengthening planning law to make best practice travel plans mandatory for workplaces, homes and other destinations.",501,51110,201505
"Eliminate pavement parking and, in close cooperation with waste collection and emergency services, make sure that these essential services have unimpeded access to all addresses.",501,51110,201505
Ensure that parking policies in residential areas deliver a high-quality street environment and reduce the numbers of those who are clogging up residential streets as part of a commuter trip or other activities not related to a visit to an address in that street.,501,51110,201505
Parking charges of all kinds in public car parks and streets will be proportionate to the full cost of providing that facility.,501,51110,201505
Provide cycle parking throughout towns and cities at locations where there is demand,501,51110,201505
and invest in on-street secure cycle storage in residential streets.,501,51110,201505
Approximately 20% of the UK population live in rural areas and many of these are retired and may have to adjust to a lifestyle without a car for health and income reasons.,503,51110,201505
It is essential that rural areas get the best possible deal for widening transport choices.,503,51110,201505
The Green Party does not accept that there is a fundamental and intractable rural transport problem.,501,51110,201505
"Rural transport in many parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland is of a very high quality and the quality is based on careful planning, coordination and investment and recognition that, although a car will be needed for a proportion of journeys, it is not the default option.",501,51110,201505
"The small village of Gempen in Switzerland, with a population of about 800, has ten buses each day that connect with tram and train services at the next-larger settlement (Dornach).",501,51110,201505
We will: Make sure that rural areas are not neglected when transport budgets and planning for our cities and city regions are under discussion.,501,51110,201505
Develop networks of community and public transport to provide regular links to onward transport networks.,501,51110,201505
Introduce speed limits of 20 mph in villages and 40 mph on rural roads.,501,51110,201505

Being rich will no longer permit people to unfairly affect the whole world’s atmosphere and climate.,107,51110,201505
The UK’s recent history has been scarred by involvement in ill-advised military interventions that have undermined our national and international security.,105,51110,201505
"The Green Party opposed these interventions, which have brought havoc to Iraq and Libya and only fragile gains in Afghanistan,",105,51110,201505
as well as driving an increased terrorist threat closer to home – all at the cost of many precious lives and vast amounts of money and other resources that could have been better used for other needs.,105,51110,201505
Green MP Caroline Lucas challenged the PM in the debate on 26 September 2014 on military action in Iraq ‘Will the Prime Minister recognise that killing extremists does not kill their ideas?,105,51110,201505
"On the contrary – it can often feed their ideas, and for that reason the former MI6 head of counter-terrorism has said that getting Saudi Arabia and Iran around a negotiating table would be far more effective than bombing.",106,51110,201505

"We would not adopt the Euro, which cannot work properly without much deeper political integration, and this would be contrary to our policy of subsidiarity.",110,51110,201505
We support the proposal to have an in–out referendum so that the British people can have their say.,202,51110,201505
This is because much has changed since the UK joined the Common Market in 1974.,110,51110,201505
"Endless debate on membership is a diversion from more important matters, such as ending inequality and adapting our economy to One-Planet Living.",110,51110,201505
"So it’s yes to Europe,",108,51110,201505
yes to reform of the EU,108,51110,201505

Migration is a fact of life.,607,51110,201505
People have always moved within countries and between countries.,607,51110,201505
"Much of the UK’s language, culture and way of life has been enriched by successive new arrivals over thousands of years.",607,51110,201505
"Most families living here will have members of their extended family who live abroad or include members who were born abroad – 5 million British citizens live abroad, around 2 million of them in the EU.",607,51110,201505
"We take it for granted that we can move to live where we like within our country, and increasingly within Europe and further afield, as others do.",607,51110,201505
"Much of the time, migration is voluntary, is on a relatively small scale and is a positive benefit for all concerned.",607,51110,201505
"But, increasingly, people are being forced to move because Climate change affects their environment so that it can no longer support them;",107,51110,201505

"or War, natural disasters or political repression lead them to become refugees.",107,51110,201505

"But it is wrong to scapegoat immigrants for problems with housing, education, health or local authority services.",503,51110,201505
"These problems are the result of successive governments’ policy failure, which the rest of this manifesto is designed to put right.",107,51110,201505

"Some controls on immigration will be needed for the foreseeable future; for now, we reject an open borders approach.",403,51110,201505
We also reject the imposition of an arbitrary numerical cap on net migration.,403,51110,201505
The latter in particular is impossible to achieve (especially given that there is no control on the numbers emigrating) and leads to many individual injustices.,503,51110,201505
Any controls must respect the following principles: Mutual legal obligations within the EU on freedom of movement.,108,51110,201505
"International obligations to accept refugees, whether seeking sanctuary from wars, political repression or climate change.",107,51110,201505

"Foreign students contribute hugely to our education system, both financially and in terms of the wider perspectives they bring.",607,51110,201505
They also take back to their home countries skills that they have learnt here that will be valuable at home and positive attitudes towards the UK.,607,51110,201505
In particular we would allow students to work in the UK for two years after graduation;,607,51110,201505
widen the Youth Mobility Scheme to allow those from poorer countries to participate.,107,51110,201505
No priority simply for economic reasons.,503,51110,201505
We would in particular aim to retain more of those trained in the UK in the health service so that we have less need to take health service workers from countries that can ill afford to lose them.,107,51110,201505
We would also: Review the rules for those wishing to set up or do business here to ensure they are not discriminatory against smaller businesses.,403,51110,201505
Not simply accept people just because they are rich.,503,51110,201505
"The London housing market in particular has been gravely distorted by the number of rich migrants buying property, bidding up prices all along the housing chain.",503,51110,201505

Ratify the International Labour Organization’s Convention on Domestic Workers.,107,51110,201505
Review asylum procedures to ensure that destitution plays no role in the asylum process by allowing those seeking sanctuary to work.,503,51110,201505
Ensure that those who have been trafficked are not subject to summary deportation; we must protect the victims of trafficking.,503,51110,201505
They should receive a temporary right to stay and have the same right to apply to remain as others seeking to migrate.,503,51110,201505
People around the world have their own strategies and priorities for improving their lives and communities.,107,51110,201505
"‘Development’ should not be directed by rich countries, which too often have their own business interests in mind.",107,51110,201505

"Genuinely fair trade, alongside sustainable haulage practices, can bring benefits for all of us.",107,51110,201505
"But ever-growing trade, over ever-growing distances and with the sole aim of making a profit can make life difficult for workers and is a sure-fire way of exceeding the limits of our finite planet.",107,51110,201505
"Similarly, the world’s current structure of international institutions and trade rules can put less developed economies at a disadvantage, while making it easy for global corporations to buy up their land and resources.",107,51110,201505
We need to work with others around the world to reform and reinvent these institutions so that they facilitate greater global equality and justice.,107,51110,201505

Support the rights of indigenous people to control their own lands and resources.,202,51110,201505
The world has become a very unequal place.,107,51110,201505
Rich countries such as the UK have benefited from global flows of wealth while poorer countries and groups have tended to lose out.,107,51110,201505

"Under Margaret Thatcher there were 1,724 new laws per year;",503,51110,201505
"Under John Major there were 2,402 per year;",503,51110,201505

It is about the power to choose who we should be governed by and the power to build a country that reflects our priorities as a nation.,602,51210,201505

Since coming to power the Tory-led British Government has removed £1.5 billion from the budget in the north.,602,51210,201505
Parties that received no popular mandate from the people have cut the public service budget allocated to the north in the form of the Departmental Expenditure Limit in 2014 by 14 per cent.,602,51210,201505
This cut has a huge impact on our budget.,602,51210,201505
In addition to this they have sought to impose harsh welfare cuts on vulnerable citizens.,602,51210,201505

There is no consideration of the needs of the people of the Six Counties and the consequences of leaving the EU on this part of Ireland.,108,51210,201505

We are working to ensure that we receive the full benefit of any decision to reduce the Corporation Tax rate.,301,51210,201505
That means that any financial benefits flowing from a reduction must be retained and reinvested here to provide for better public services,301,51210,201505

During the negotiations which led to the Stormont House Agreement Sinn Féin resisted attempts by the British Government and other parties to have current and future inquests removed from Coroners’ Courts and placed within the remit of the Historical Investigations Unit.,602,51210,201505
Once again the British government and its allies within unionism sought to thwart the efforts of embattled families seeking the truth about the circumstances of their loved ones’ deaths.,602,51210,201505
For Sinn Féin this was a red-line issue we would not cross.,602,51210,201505
That resistance has ensured that families will have Article 2 compliant inquests and we will continue to give full support to them as they seek to achieve maximum disclosure from a reluctant British government.,602,51210,201505
The creation of the Historical Investigation Unit (HIU) provides families with the opportunity to learn more about the truth surrounding the death of their loved ones.,602,51210,201505
The Stormont House Agreement commits the British government to making full disclosure to the HIU and we will be seeking to ensure that they do not resile from their commitment to supply all of the relevant information to the families.,602,51210,201505
We continue to press the British government to hold a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane.,602,51210,201505
"During the negotiations in December the Irish government, despite its alleged support for such an inquiry, failed miserably to address this issue and hold the British government to account.",602,51210,201505

and of the Ballymurphy massacre.,602,51210,201505
Sinn Féin have honoured all agreements that we have entered into.,305,51210,201505
Making and implementing agreements is the foundation stone of the political process.,202,51210,201505
"There are key elements of the Good Friday Agreement that have still not been implemented, including a Bill of Rights",201,51210,201505
and the establishment of a Civic Forum.,202,51210,201505
In addition at Weston Park the British government agreed to establish a full inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.,602,51210,201505
At St Andrew’s in 2006 there was a commitment made by the British government to legislate for the Irish language through an Acht Gaeilge.,602,51210,201505
They reneged on those commitments too.,602,51210,201505
Since the Stormont House Agreement was reached on the cusp of Christmas Eve Sinn Féin has engaged positively with the Party Leaders’ group to ensure its full implementation.,301,51210,201505
This includes the provision agreed to protect welfare benefits,504,51210,201505
Sinn Féin continues to demand the implementation of all outstanding agreements,504,51210,201505
and will continue to work constructively to drive forward the peace process.,106,51210,201505
Continue to work for full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.,106,51210,201505

Deliver a referendum on Irish unity.,602,51210,201505
Deliver the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.,301,51210,201505
Our manifesto begins with the Budget Responsibility Lock we offer the British people.,414,51320,201505
It is the basis for all our plans in this manifesto because it is by securing our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the working people of Britain.,414,51320,201505
Every policy in this manifesto is paid for.,414,51320,201505
Not one commitment requires additional borrowing.,414,51320,201505
We are the first party to make that pledge and with this manifesto it is delivered.,414,51320,201505
We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility.,414,51320,201505
A Labour government will cut the deficit every year.,414,51320,201505
The first line of Labour’s first Budget will be: “This Budget cuts the deficit every year”.,414,51320,201505
"This manifesto sets out that we will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the OBR will independently verify.",414,51320,201505
We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next parliament.,414,51320,201505
This manifesto sets out that we will not compromise on this commitment.,414,51320,201505
Britain is a great country ready to build a better future.,601,51320,201505
This manifesto sets out Labour’s plan for national renewal.,601,51320,201505
"The British people, are known for tolerance, responsibility to others and for our belief in the value of hard work.",601,51320,201505
We look confidently outward to the world.,601,51320,201505
"These are great British traditions - things we all believe in, things our country is good at.",601,51320,201505
We are at our best when we work together.,601,51320,201505
"We see this every day in our workplaces, in our families, and in our communities.",601,51320,201505
"People want to get on, they want to give their children a better future, and they want to help to change Britain for the better.",601,51320,201505
But across Britain working people also know a simple truth: the economy is not working for them.,701,51320,201505
"For years now, our economy has not rewarded everyone who put in a good, honest day’s work.",701,51320,201505
"However hard people work, many don’t earn enough to make ends meet.",701,51320,201505
"Too many have been driven from secure, full-time work, into precarious, badly paid jobs – many working on zero-hours contracts.",701,51320,201505
"Time to enjoy friends and family is increasingly squeezed, as mothers and fathers juggle the demands of work and caring for children, and often an older relative.",701,51320,201505
The problems mount for the next generation too.,706,51320,201505
Young people are taking on a mountain of debt to go to university and too many still cannot find a job worthy of their talents.,701,51320,201505
We lack a proper system of vocational education and apprenticeships to give our young people the start in life that they deserve.,411,51320,201505
We are not building the homes we need.,410,51320,201505
Our sons and daughters have been shut out of the housing market and too often they are forced to leave the communities where they were brought up.,503,51320,201505
Our economy and our system of government are failing people.,202,51320,201505
Many have come to believe that politics ignores the things that matter to them.,202,51320,201505
"Too much power is unaccountable, concentrated in the market and the state, at the expense of individuals and their communities.",202,51320,201505
Many of these problems have been mounting for years.,202,51320,201505
"Some, like the rise of inequality, are felt in countries all around the world.",503,51320,201505
"So the Conservatives did not cause all of them, but they have made them far worse.",305,51320,201505
Their view is that economic success depends just on a few at the top.,503,51320,201505
They think that insecurity will make people work harder and that low pay is the only way to be competitive in the global market.,503,51320,201505
They don’t believe we can afford decent public services when times are hard.,409,51320,201505
"They have been giving power to large unaccountable firms rather than to people,",403,51320,201505
and now they want to make deeper cuts in the next three years than we have seen in the last five years.,409,51320,201505
There are some who believe there is nothing we can do to change things for the better.,409,51320,201505
They feel powerless.,409,51320,201505
They are losing faith that those with power will ever listen to them.,409,51320,201505
We understand these feelings.,409,51320,201505
But we believe we can renew our country and make a better future for working people.,503,51320,201505
We have learned the lessons of the past.,409,51320,201505
We were in government for thirteen years and left the country a far better place to live in.,409,51320,201505
But we did not get everything right.,305,51320,201505
We have learned and we have changed.,305,51320,201505
"Labour is renewing our traditions as the Party of work, family and community.",606,51320,201505
"We believe in a society of trust and mutual obligation,",606,51320,201505
"in which we look after the vulnerable, and people can bring up their families with hope for a better future.",503,51320,201505
"And we believe in helping people to help themselves, both to improve their own communities, and to achieve their ambitions.",503,51320,201505
We are also the Party of equality.,503,51320,201505
We believe that no person should suffer discrimination or a lack of opportunity.,503,51320,201505
The decisions we take in government will always be taken with this in mind.,503,51320,201505
The policies in our manifesto will help remove the barriers that stand in the way of greater equality.,503,51320,201505
We know we achieve more when we work together to challenge inequalities of power and build a common good.,503,51320,201505
"In this election, the country has a choice.",403,51320,201505
We can continue with a Conservative plan based on the view that success comes only from a privileged few at the top.,403,51320,201505
"Or we can change direction, begin to return power to people and build an economy together in which everyone can contribute to a shared and enduring prosperity.",403,51320,201505
We believe that Britain only succeeds when working families succeed.,701,51320,201505
"As the economy at last recovers, people want the opportunity to use their skills and talents to make a better life for themselves and their children.",701,51320,201505
Our country’s greatest asset is the hard work and talent of our people.,701,51320,201505
"Labour’s plan is to build firmer economic foundations for creating wealth, rewarding hard work and competing in the world.",403,51320,201505
"We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on the current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament.",414,51320,201505
"This will need common sense spending reductions,",414,51320,201505
"outside of the protected areas of health,",504,51320,201505
education,506,51320,201505
and international development.,107,51320,201505
"We will ask those with incomes over £150,000 a year to contribute a little more through a 50p rate of tax.",414,51320,201505
"And we will build the high-skill, high-wage economy we need to raise tax revenues and control social security spending.",414,51320,201505
"We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019,",412,51320,201505
banning exploitative zero-hours contracts,412,51320,201505
and promoting the Living Wage.,412,51320,201505
"We will create more paths to success for our young people by introducing a gold-standard system of technical education and training,",411,51320,201505
and the guarantee of an apprenticeship for every school leaver with the grades.,411,51320,201505
"We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds,",504,51320,201505
while doubling paid paternity leave for fathers.,504,51320,201505
"We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until 2017, while reforming the broken energy market.",412,51320,201505
"And we will make sure that at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020,",408,51320,201505
and that private renters get a fairer deal.,403,51320,201505
The Bedroom Tax is cruel and we will abolish it.,504,51320,201505
"We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives,",504,51320,201505
"paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.",504,51320,201505
"And we will bring together services for physical health, mental health and social care into a single system built around the individual.",504,51320,201505
We want a high quality education for all of our children.,506,51320,201505
"We will protect the education budget and raise teaching standards, making sure there are smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.",506,51320,201505
The common life we share is who we are as a country.,601,51320,201505
"Not everyone is the same, but each of us sharing a sense of belonging, being valued equally and being able to contribute to the common good.",601,51320,201505
"Immigration has made an important contribution to our economic and social life,",601,51320,201505
but it needs to be properly controlled.,601,51320,201505
"With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years.",110,51320,201505
"We will make it illegal to undercut wages by exploiting migrant workers,",701,51320,201505
and work to strengthen integration within our communities.,608,51320,201505
Everyone who works with the public in our public services must be able to speak English.,608,51320,201505
"We will help to make communities safer, by protecting and strengthening neighbourhood policing,",605,51320,201505
"countering extremism,",605,51320,201505
and putting in place tough new laws to reduce violence against women and,605,51320,201505
child sexual exploitation,605,51320,201505
People want more say in the decisions that affect their lives.,202,51320,201505
"We, in Labour, know that Government has to do things differently.",202,51320,201505
"The old command and control politics – doing things to and for people, but never with them – will not work.",202,51320,201505
We need a new approach to government that involves more people in decisions that affect them.,202,51320,201505
"So we will devolve more power and control, not only to Scotland and Wales, but to our great English cities and county regions too.",301,51320,201505
And we will share power and responsibility with people in their communities to help them help themselves and shape their services in response to their local circumstances.,301,51320,201505
"Our country faces global challenges of climate change,",501,51320,201505
terrorism,605,51320,201505
and the spread of disease.,605,51320,201505
"In particular, tackling climate change is an economic necessity and the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and future generations.",501,51320,201505
A Labour government will face up to these challenges and re-engage with the world.,501,51320,201505
"We will build alliances in Europe, promoting our country’s interests and security,",108,51320,201505
and standing up for human rights and social justice.,201,51320,201505
"We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our membership of it.",108,51320,201505
"Labour’s plan for national renewal will bring about real, meaningful change that each person will be able to feel in their daily life.",601,51320,201505
"We know that to make Britain a better country, opportunity must belong to everyone and not just a few.",503,51320,201505
"We will lend a helping hand to all those who need it, but we will also ask more of individuals and communities.",606,51320,201505
We can only rebuild our country if everyone plays their part and feels they have a stake in society.,606,51320,201505
We believe in living within our means.,414,51320,201505
"We will not make promises we cannot keep, and we will not introduce changes unless they are funded.",414,51320,201505
There is not a single policy in this manifesto that is funded by additional borrowing.,414,51320,201505
Not a single one.,414,51320,201505
"Our plan is to build a secure, prosperous and more equal country open to the world, in which everyone has the opportunity to get on and do their best.",601,51320,201505
We will provide strong and effective government but everyone will need to contribute and play their part.,601,51320,201505
"It will be hard, but working together we can do it.",601,51320,201505
We know a simple truth.,701,51320,201505
Britain only succeeds when working families succeed.,701,51320,201505
It is how our country has won through in the past and how it will succeed in the future.,701,51320,201505
But so many people are putting in the hours and not seeing the rewards.,701,51320,201505
That is why there is a cost of living crisis.,701,51320,201505
Our first task in government is to change our economy so that it works for all of Britain’s businesses and working people.,403,51320,201505
The Conservatives claim that the economy is fixed and that our country is on the right track.,403,51320,201505
"But the economy is not creating the productive, high-skilled and well-paid jobs that we need to raise living standards.",701,51320,201505
"The lack of rewarding work and training opportunities is trapping hundreds of thousands of young people in a cycle of benefits and low-paid, insecure jobs.",701,51320,201505
"And consumers are overcharged in markets they rely on to meet their everyday needs, whether to heat their homes or travel to work.",403,51320,201505
"For most of the 20th century, there was a vital link between the success of the country and family finances.",601,51320,201505
"As the country got better off, so did working people.",701,51320,201505
But the link between the success of the country and the family budget has been broken.,701,51320,201505
"Since 2010, working people are earning on average £1,600 less a year after inflation.",701,51320,201505
We have seen the greatest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874.,701,51320,201505
"Over five million people are in low-paid jobs, earning less than the Living Wage.",701,51320,201505
There are 1.8 million zero-hours contracts.,701,51320,201505
1.3 million are working part-time because they cannot get a full-time job.,701,51320,201505
Half of all those in poverty live in working households.,701,51320,201505
"900,000 people, many of them in work, used food banks last year.",701,51320,201505
"This cost-of-living crisis is bad for families, bad for business, and bad for Britain.",601,51320,201505
Lower levels of pay have meant lower tax receipts and higher spending on social security.,701,51320,201505
We will have to work and earn our way toward a more fairly shared and enduring prosperity.,701,51320,201505
We are a great commercial nation that has been at the centre of global trade for centuries.,401,51320,201505
We have a long tradition of innovation and enterprise.,411,51320,201505
We have been quick to seize the opportunities of the internet.,411,51320,201505
We have big strengths to build upon:,411,51320,201505
"world-leading universities,",411,51320,201505
"an outstanding science research base,",411,51320,201505
an open economy with one of the highest rates of foreign direct investment in the world,401,51320,201505
", and many successful global companies.",401,51320,201505
"An inclusive wealth-creating economy works when there is a shared sense of responsibility, so we will be a government that is both pro-business and pro-worker.",405,51320,201505
"We value all our businesses as organisations of innovation and wealth production, and we will work strategically with them to create wealth.",405,51320,201505
We value our trade unions as an essential force for a decent society and as guarantors of skills and fair wages.,405,51320,201505
The next Labour Government will balance the books.,414,51320,201505
"We will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the Office for Budget Responsibility will independently verify.",414,51320,201505
We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next Parliament and these fiscal commitments will not be compromised.,414,51320,201505
We will tackle the root causes of the deficit by building a more productive economy with living standards that rise year-on-year.,414,51320,201505
The Conservative-led Government promised to balance the books in this Parliament.,414,51320,201505
But this promise has been broken.,414,51320,201505
The Conservatives will leave the country borrowing over £75 billion this year.,414,51320,201505
"Labour’s plan to balance the books means making tough, but fairer choices.",414,51320,201505
"We will reverse the Government’s top-rate tax cut so that the highest one per cent of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get the deficit down.",414,51320,201505
"We will stop paying Winter Fuel Payments to the richest five per cent of pensioners, and cap child benefit rises for two years.",414,51320,201505
"Outside of the protected areas of health, education and international development there will be cuts in spending.",414,51320,201505
Ministerial pay will be cut and then frozen until we have balanced the books.,414,51320,201505
All proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS will be used to repay the national debt.,414,51320,201505
We will live within our means.,414,51320,201505
We have no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing.,414,51320,201505
All of our commitments will be paid for by reducing spending elsewhere or by raising extra revenue.,414,51320,201505
"For example, we will introduce a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for an NHS Time to Care Fund –",414,51320,201505
part of our plan to save and improve the health service.,504,51320,201505
We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at each general election.,414,51320,201505
We will cap structural social security expenditure in each spending review so that it is properly controlled.,414,51320,201505
"We will implement the proposals of Labour’s Zero-Based Review, which has already identified savings we will make through reforming old government bureaucracies,",303,51320,201505
"devolving power and services to our towns and cities,",301,51320,201505
"and redesigning public services, and which we will continue in government.",504,51320,201505
We will invest to prevent social problems rather than waste money reacting to them.,504,51320,201505
"And we will use digital technology to create a more responsive, devolved, and less costly system of government.",303,51320,201505
"We will create a fairer tax system, helping those on middle and lower incomes by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax, paid for by ending the Conservatives’ Marriage Tax Allowance.",503,51320,201505
We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.,503,51320,201505
"Nor will we raise VAT, and we renew our pledge not to extend it to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers or public transport fares.",503,51320,201505
Our first Finance Bill will close the tax loopholes that cost the Exchequer billions of pounds a year.,403,51320,201505
"We will introduce tougher penalties for those abusing the tax system, end unfair tax breaks used by hedge funds and others, and bear down on disguised employment.",403,51320,201505
"We will seek international agreement to make country-by-country reporting information publicly available, and we will act at home if agreement is not reached.",403,51320,201505
British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies will be required to produce publicly available registries of the real owners of companies based there.,403,51320,201505
We will carry out an immediate review into the culture and practices of HMRC so that everyone follows the same rules and we increase the rigour of the tax system.,303,51320,201505
And we will abolish non-dom status so that all those who make the UK their home pay tax in the same way as the rest of us.,403,51320,201505
It is by tackling tax avoidance in this concerted fashion that we can reduce the deficit and protect the family budgets of working people.,414,51320,201505
"Labour will improve productivity by building a long-term investment culture in the private and public sectors,",404,51320,201505
and supporting small businesses in their growth to becoming British success stories of the future.,403,51320,201505
"With Labour, Britain will continue to have the most competitive rate of Corporation Tax in the G7.",402,51320,201505
Building world-class infrastructure will be crucial to fostering economic growth.,411,51320,201505
We will create certainty for investors by taking a long-term approach to the major investment decisions facing the country.,404,51320,201505
We will set up an independent National Infrastructure Commission to assess how best to meet Britain’s infrastructure needs.,411,51320,201505
"It will make recommendations to government, monitor their implementation, and hold government to account.",411,51320,201505
These measures and our long-term approach will help reinforce Britain’s status as one of the world’s greatest centres of science and engineering.,411,51320,201505
"We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs down,",411,51320,201505
and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to boost its regional economies.,411,51320,201505
"We will support long-term investment in strategic roads, address the neglect of local roads, and promote cycling.",411,51320,201505
"Following the Davies Review, we will make a swift decision on expanding airport capacity in London and the South East,",411,51320,201505
balancing the need for growth and the environmental impact.,416,51320,201505
Scientific discovery and technological innovation will drive economic advancement this century.,411,51320,201505
"We will introduce a new long-term funding policy framework for science and innovation, providing the stability and continuity that our companies and research institutes need to succeed.",411,51320,201505
"We will work to make Britain a world leader in low carbon technologies over the next decade,",501,51320,201505
creating a million additional green jobs.,501,51320,201505
"This aim will be supported by ambitious domestic carbon reduction targets, including a legal target to remove the carbon from our electricity supply by 2030,",501,51320,201505
and a major drive for energy efficiency.,501,51320,201505
"Our industrial strategy for the green economy will end the current uncertainty for investors, with a timetable for the Green Investment Bank to be given additional powers so that it can invest in green businesses and technology.",501,51320,201505
"We will create an Energy Security Board to plan and deliver the energy mix we need, including renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal.",501,51320,201505
"For onshore unconventional oil and gas, we will establish a robust environmental and regulatory regime before extraction can take place.",501,51320,201505
"And to safeguard the future of the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a long-term strategy for the industry, including more certainty on tax rates",404,51320,201505
and making the most of the potential for carbon storage.,501,51320,201505
Labour’s longer-term approach will drive innovation and build on our strengths as a leader in digital technology.,411,51320,201505
We are just at the start of the internet revolution.,411,51320,201505
Digital technology has transformed start-up costs making it easier to run your own business.,411,51320,201505
"There is a widening in the application of new transformative technologies in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3D printing and Big Data.",411,51320,201505
Our economy is developing a network of connections that will revolutionise innovation.,411,51320,201505
"Labour will ensure that all parts of the country benefit from affordable, high speed broadband by the end of the Parliament.",411,51320,201505
"We will work with the industry and the regulator to maximise private sector investment and deliver the mobile infrastructure needed to extend coverage and reduce ‘not spots’, including in areas of market failure.",411,51320,201505
And we will support community-based campaigns to reduce the proportion of citizens unable to use the internet and help those who need it to get the skills to make the most of digital technology.,411,51320,201505
Our universities are amongst the finest in the world.,411,51320,201505
Some are already helping our regional economies by forming strong links with industry and creating high-tech clusters.,411,51320,201505
They have already spun out hundreds of companies creating thousands of jobs.,411,51320,201505
"We will support this model of knowledge clusters, especially outside the South East.",411,51320,201505
"Britain’s economy is being held back by the culture of short-termism, which is a major obstacle to the development of productive businesses and industries.",410,51320,201505
We will reform corporate governance to protect our leading firms from the pressure to put tomorrow’s share price before long-term growth potential.,403,51320,201505
Institutional investors will have a duty to act in the best interests of ordinary savers.,403,51320,201505
They will have to prioritise long-term growth over short-term profits for the companies in which they are investing.,403,51320,201505
We will change takeover rules to enhance the role of long-term investors by restricting voting to those already holding shares when a bid is made.,403,51320,201505
"In addition, we will strengthen the public interest test.",403,51320,201505
"We will improve the link between executive pay and performance by simplifying pay packages, and requiring investment and pension fund managers to disclose how they vote on top pay",403,51320,201505
And we will make sure employees have a voice when executive pay is set by requiring employee representation on remuneration committees.,403,51320,201505
"In this way we can start to create an economy based on mutual obligations, encouraging employers and employees to build partnerships for improving both business performance and job quality.",403,51320,201505
"Outdated practices, like blacklisting, have no place in a modern economy.",403,51320,201505
"Our charities, mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises are pioneering new models of production that enhance social value, promote financial inclusion, and give individuals and communities power and control.",403,51320,201505
We will continue to support and help develop the social economy by improving access for co-operative and mutual organisations to growth finance through the new British Investment Bank.,403,51320,201505
And we will consider how to support employee buy-outs when businesses are being sold.,403,51320,201505
"We will safeguard the public interest in the Royal Mail, supporting the creation of a staff-led trust for the employee share, and keeping the remaining 30 per cent in public ownership.",413,51320,201505
"We will also support the universal service obligation, ensuring competition does not undermine it and introducing protections as necessary.",403,51320,201505
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.,403,51320,201505
Their creativity and dynamism are vital for raising productivity and competing in the global economy.,403,51320,201505
"Labour will give them a voice at the heart of government – a Small Business Administration, which will ensure procurement contracts are accessible and regulations are designed with small firms in mind.",403,51320,201505
We will address rising costs for small businesses and strengthen rules on late payment.,403,51320,201505
Labour will put small businesses first in line for tax cuts.,402,51320,201505
"Instead of cutting Corporation Tax again for the largest firms, we will cut, and then freeze business rates for over 1.5 million smaller business properties.",402,51320,201505
We will develop a banking system that works for businesses in every region and every sector in Britain.,404,51320,201505
The long-standing problems of our banking system mean that too many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get the finance they need to invest and grow.,403,51320,201505
Labour will establish a British Investment Bank with the mission to help businesses grow and to create wealth and jobs.,402,51320,201505
"It will have the resources to improve access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and will support a network of regional banks.",402,51320,201505
We will increase competition on the high street.,403,51320,201505
Following the Competition and Market Authorities inquiry we want a market share test and at least two new challenger banks.,403,51320,201505
"And we will deal with the scourge of household debt by introducing a new levy on payday lenders, using the funds raised to boost low-cost alternatives like credit unions.",403,51320,201505
Britain’s route to prosperity and higher living standards is through more secure and better paid jobs,701,51320,201505
. But Conservative policies are causing whole sectors of the economy to be dragged into a race to the bottom on wages and skills.,701,51320,201505
The Government has weakened employment rights and promoted a hire-andfire culture.,701,51320,201505
"Labour believes our economy can only succeed in a race to the top – competing in the world with better work, better pay and better skills.",701,51320,201505
Too many people do a hard day’s work but remain dependent on benefits.,701,51320,201505
"We will raise the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, bringing it closer to average earnings.",412,51320,201505
We will give local authorities a role in strengthening enforcement against those paying less than the legal amount.,301,51320,201505
"And we will support employers to pay more by using government procurement to promote the Living Wage, alongside wider social impact considerations.",701,51320,201505
Our Make Work Pay contracts will give tax rebates to businesses who sign up to paying the Living Wage in the first year of a Labour Government.,402,51320,201505
Publicly listed companies will be required to report on whether or not they pay the Living Wage.,701,51320,201505
It is hard for Britain to succeed when employees feel insecure and employers are undercut by those using exploitative working practices.,701,51320,201505
Labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts.,701,51320,201505
Those who work regular hours for more than 12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract.,701,51320,201505
We will abolish the loophole that allows firms to undercut permanent staff by using agency workers on lower pay.,701,51320,201505
"The Conservatives have introduced fees of up to £1,200 for employment tribunal claimants, creating a significant barrier to workplace justice.",701,51320,201505
"We will abolish the Government’s employment tribunal fee system as part of wider reforms to make sure that affordability is not a barrier to workers having proper access to justice,",701,51320,201505
"employers get a quicker resolution,",701,51320,201505
and the costs to the tax payer do not rise.,701,51320,201505
"Labour is the Party of work, and we value working life.",701,51320,201505
We will push up standards and boost productivity by implementing the commitments in Labour’s Workplace and Business manifestos.,701,51320,201505
"Over 700,000 of our young people are unemployed",701,51320,201505
Too many of them do not have the skills they need for work.,701,51320,201505
And yet in the past year the number of young people starting apprenticeships has fallen.,701,51320,201505
"The Government’s decision to triple university tuition fees leaves young people either starting their working lives burdened by £44,000 of debt, or without a clear alternative path to a decent career.",701,51320,201505
"Labour will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, funded by restricting tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners and clamping down on tax avoidance.",506,51320,201505
We will tackle the growth of unpaid internships because thousands of highly able young people who cannot afford to work for free are locked out of too many of our professions.,701,51320,201505
"We will introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax.",701,51320,201505
"It will provide a paid starter job for every young person unemployed for over a year, a job which they will have to take or lose benefits.",701,51320,201505
For too long we have failed to provide a system which makes the best use of the talents of young people.,706,51320,201505
So we will guarantee every school leaver that gets the grades an apprenticeship.,411,51320,201505
"We will create thousands more apprenticeships in the public sector, including the civil service.",411,51320,201505
"Every firm getting a major government contract, and every large employer hiring skilled workers from outside the EU, will be required to offer apprenticeships.",411,51320,201505
We will give employers more control over apprenticeships funding and standards.,411,51320,201505
"In return, we will ask them to increase the number of high quality apprenticeships in their sectors and supply chains.",411,51320,201505
We will also give them the powers to deal with any free-riding employers who do not train.,403,51320,201505
Labour’s apprenticeships will be gold-standard qualifications.,411,51320,201505
"We will re-focus existing spending away from low-level apprenticeships for older people, and towards a system where apprenticeships are focused on new job entrants, lasting at least two years, and providing level three qualifications or above.",411,51320,201505
We will make sure that apprenticeships can lead to higher level qualifications by creating new Technical Degrees and supporting part-time study.,411,51320,201505
"They will be co-funded, co-designed and co-delivered by employers and they will be the priority for expansion within our university system.",411,51320,201505
"Young people who do not have the skills they need should be in training, not on benefits.",411,51320,201505
We will replace out of work benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds with a new Youth Allowance dependent on recipients being in training and targeted at those who need it most.,504,51320,201505
Labour will stand up for working families and businesses against vested interests.,403,51320,201505
We will reform the broken markets that people rely on most so that families and businesses get a fair deal.,403,51320,201505
Energy bills have risen by over £300 since 2010.,403,51320,201505
Many businesses say energy is the biggest cost they face.,403,51320,201505
"Lack of competition and transparency has allowed the large energy companies to get away with increasing bills when wholesale prices rise, but not cutting them when they fall.",403,51320,201505
The regulator has failed to take decisive action to protect consumers.,403,51320,201505
"Labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not rise, and we will give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter.",412,51320,201505
"During the freeze, we will reform the energy market so that it delivers fairer prices and a better deal for working families.",412,51320,201505
The generation and supply businesses of the ‘Big Six’ energy companies will be separated.,403,51320,201505
"They will be required to open up their books, and they will have to sell their electricity through an open exchange.",403,51320,201505
We will simplify energy tariffs and make it easier for people to compare prices to get the best deal.,412,51320,201505
We will protect small businesses by ending unfair contracts and automatic rollovers to more expensive tariffs.,403,51320,201505
"A tough new energy watchdog will enforce our reforms, with powers to strip energy companies of their licences if they repeatedly harm the interests of consumers, and protect off-grid households.",403,51320,201505
"We will bring down energy bills by making homes more energy efficient, delivering a million interest free loans for energy home improvements in the next Parliament.",409,51320,201505
"For those on low incomes, we will make 200,000 homes warm every year, delivered street-by-street by local authorities and community organisations.",504,51320,201505
"Privately rented properties will have to meet a decency standard, bringing warmth to a further three million homes.",403,51320,201505
"The water industry, too, also requires reform.",403,51320,201505
One in five people struggle to pay their water bill.,403,51320,201505
"Despite this, only a fraction of customers have benefited from the social tariffs offered by water companies.",403,51320,201505
"Under our reforms all water companies will be required to sign up to a new national affordability scheme, helping those who cannot afford to pay their water bill.",403,51320,201505
"And we will strengthen the powers of the regulator to change licenses, limit price rises and enforce industry standards.",403,51320,201505
Living standards have been hit by fare increases on public transport.,403,51320,201505
"Since 2010, rail fares have risen by 20 per cent, leaving passengers paying the highest fares in Europe.",403,51320,201505
"Similarly, bus fares have risen by 27 per cent while at the same time 2,000 bus routes have been cut.",403,51320,201505
Labour will reform our transport system in order to provide more public control and put the public interest first.,403,51320,201505
We will review the franchising process as a priority to put in place a new system and avoid a repeat of the Conservatives’ franchising fiasco.,403,51320,201505
A new National Rail body will oversee and plan for the railways and give rail users a greater say in how trains operate.,403,51320,201505
We will legislate so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the private train operating companies on a level playing field.,403,51320,201505
Rail fares will be frozen next year to help commuters while we implement reforms.,412,51320,201505
"A strict fare rise cap will be introduced on every route for any future fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the cheapest ticket for their journey.",412,51320,201505
City and county regions will be given more power over the way buses are operated in their area.,301,51320,201505
"They will be able to decide routes, bear down on fares, drive improvements in services, and bring together trains, buses and trams into a single network with smart ticketing.",301,51320,201505
cut the deficit every year and balance the books as soon as possible in the  next Parliament,414,51320,201505
reverse the 50p tax cut so that the top one per cent pay a little more to help  get the deficit down,414,51320,201505
"not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax, National Insurance or  VAT",503,51320,201505
cut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive corporate tax rates in the G7,402,51320,201505
abolish non dom status,403,51320,201505
increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October  2019,412,51320,201505
and introduce Make Work Pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms  becoming Living Wage employers,402,51320,201505
ban exploitative zero-hours contracts,701,51320,201505
guarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the  grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer  apprenticeships,411,51320,201505
"reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year",506,51320,201505
freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter,412,51320,201505
introduce a British Investment Bank and support a network of regional banks.,414,51320,201505
"Our NHS, care services, schools, colleges and other public services make up the essential fabric of our society.",601,51320,201505
People need them to be able to live secure and fulfilling lives.,601,51320,201505
Britain needs them if we are to succeed as a country.,601,51320,201505
But under the Conservatives they are under threat.,601,51320,201505
"The next Labour Government will protect, improve and invest in our public services,",504,51320,201505
while giving individuals and communities more control over their design and delivery.,301,51320,201505
"The NHS is one of our great national institutions,",601,51320,201505
and it is one of Labour’s proudest achievements.,601,51320,201505
"It embodies our belief that by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone.",601,51320,201505
But the future of the NHS is under threat.,504,51320,201505
"The Conservatives have put the wrong values at its heart, and patients are finding it harder to get the care they need.",504,51320,201505
Care is at the heart of Labour’s values.,504,51320,201505
No-one should fear old age or be left to struggle alone caring for a loved one.,504,51320,201505
"But too many older people suffer insecurity, loneliness and exclusion.",504,51320,201505
And the growing social care crisis is one of the biggest challenges we face.,504,51320,201505
"Since 2010, billions of pounds have been cut from budgets that pay for adult social care.",504,51320,201505
"The result has been 300,000 fewer older people getting vital care services, at the same time as the number of older people in need of care is increasing.",504,51320,201505
A good education is vital to achieving personal fulfillment and economic prosperity.,506,51320,201505
A good society depends upon an education system that can open minds and teach the skills and knowledge we each need to get on in life.,506,51320,201505
But our education system is failing to meet the needs of young people who do not follow the traditional academic path from school to university.,506,51320,201505
Our public services are a measure of the strength and decency of our society.,601,51320,201505
But we need a change in how we design them by pushing power down and organising them around individuals and families not centralised bureaucracies.,301,51320,201505
Good public services also need committed staff who are treated fairly and whose ethos of service is respected.,701,51320,201505
"They require decisions on pay that prioritise those on lower incomes, which are evidence-based, and which respect Pay Review Body recommendations rather than brushing them aside irresponsibly.",701,51320,201505
"Government spends far too much money dealing with the symptoms of problems, instead of investing smaller amounts in dealing with their causes.",504,51320,201505
"Every taxpayer pays the cost of low educational achievement, poor aspirations, drink and drug misuse, and criminality.",504,51320,201505
"So we will promote early-years intervention, supporting young children and their parents and dealing with problems before they get out of hand.",504,51320,201505
We can save money and create more responsive services by building co-operation between public services and organisations.,504,51320,201505
Pooling funds across local areas reduces inefficiency and avoids duplication.,504,51320,201505
Services must be joined up in ways that make sense to the people who use them.,504,51320,201505
Labour will use digital technology in reforming our public services.,411,51320,201505
"People will be able to feed back on services quickly and simply, making sure their voices are heard, stimulating improvement and saving on the costs of service failure.",504,51320,201505
"Labour will rescue our NHS, invest in its future and join up services from home to hospital.",504,51320,201505
We will start with the promise of investment so that the NHS has time to care.,504,51320,201505
The NHS is struggling with staffing shortages.,504,51320,201505
"Accident and emergency is in crisis, and more people are facing long waits for tests, treatment, or to see a GP.",504,51320,201505
"Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.",504,51320,201505
"The threshold for the Mansion Tax will rise in line with house prices for these high-value properties, and those on lower incomes will be protected with a right to defer the charge until the property changes hands.",504,51320,201505
"We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours, and on the same day for those who need it.",504,51320,201505
"We will create a Cancer Treatments Fund so patients have access to the latest drugs, surgery and radiotherapy.",504,51320,201505
"By 2020, patients will wait no longer than one week for vital cancer tests.",504,51320,201505
"Catching the disease early is critical, so we will raise public awareness of symptoms and make sure there is training and support for GPs in spotting early signs.",504,51320,201505
"The answer to the health challenges we face is not to set hospital against hospital, but to join up services around patients’ needs.",504,51320,201505
"We will repeal the Government’s Health and Social Care Act, scrapping the competition regime and restoring proper democratic accountability for the NHS.",202,51320,201505
"We will establish a sensible commissioning framework, based on the principle of an NHS preferred provider, to stop the drive towards privatisation and make sure that NHS services are not destabilised by competition and fragmentation.",504,51320,201505
"Where private companies are involved in providing clinical services, we will impose a cap on any profits they can make from the NHS, to ensure that the needs of patients are always put first.",504,51320,201505
We support the principles behind the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Treaty (TTIP).,107,51320,201505
"We will hold the European Commission to account on issues of concern, including the impact on public services and the Investor to State Dispute Settlement Mechanism.",108,51320,201505
And we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty.,504,51320,201505
"Our health reforms will focus on prevention and early intervention, and joining up services from home to hospital.",504,51320,201505
"When people cannot get to see their GP, many go to A&E instead.",504,51320,201505
"When mental health problems are not spotted early, people can deteriorate and need more intensive support.",504,51320,201505
"And when elderly people cannot get the care they need at home, they are more likely to end up in hospital.",504,51320,201505
The current system is too fragmented.,504,51320,201505
It was not designed for the growing numbers of people living with chronic conditions or multiple needs.,504,51320,201505
"Rather than having three separate systems for dealing with physical, mental and social care, we will create a whole person approach: a single service to meet all of a person’s health and care needs.",504,51320,201505
This will be underpinned by new rights for patients.,504,51320,201505
"Vulnerable older people, disabled people and those with complex needs will be helped to have more control of their lives with the entitlement to a personal care plan designed with them and shaped around their needs, the option of personal budgets where appropriate, and a single named person to coordinate their care.",503,51320,201505
They will also receive better information and advice on managing their condition.,503,51320,201505
These changes will help to end the frustration of families sick of being passed from pillar to post between different individuals and agencies.,503,51320,201505
"Commissioning and budgets will be brought together at a local level to join up services and make sure that providers are incentivised to help people stay healthy and outside hospital, rather than simply waiting for them to fall ill.",503,51320,201505
Mental health will be given the same priority as physical health.,504,51320,201505
People will have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs and medical treatments.,504,51320,201505
"To help address the problem of undiagnosed mental illness, NHS staff training will include mental health.",504,51320,201505
"We will increase the proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link children up with support.",504,51320,201505
"To support young people’s health and wellbeing, we will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example through the use of mindfulness to build resilience.",504,51320,201505
"And we will set out a strategy with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access school-based counselling.",504,51320,201505
"A greater emphasis on prevention and public health is essential, not just to improve outcomes and tackle inequalities, but to ensure the NHS remains sustainable.",504,51320,201505
"For example, 3.2 million people are currently diagnosed with diabetes, and it is estimated that spending on treatment will rise from £10 billion to £17 billion a year over the next 25 years if action is not taken, such as to reduce levels of obesity.",504,51320,201505
"We will set a new national ambition to improve the uptake of physical activity and take targeted action on those high strength, low cost alcohol products that fuel problem drinking.",504,51320,201505
"And we will set maximum permitted levels of sugar, salt and fat in foods marketed substantially to children.",504,51320,201505
"Everyone involved in the NHS must learn lessons when things go wrong, for example, from the failings at Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay.",504,51320,201505
Labour will prioritise action to improve care quality and patient safety.,504,51320,201505
"In addition to recruiting extra nurses to help provide safe levels of staffing on wards, we want every hospital death to be subject to an appropriate level of review.",504,51320,201505
We will also take action to modernise the regulation of healthcare professionals.,504,51320,201505
Labour will support people in their older age.,504,51320,201505
Growing old should be a positive and fulfilling experience.,504,51320,201505
"But our social care system is close to collapse, with older people often receiving visits limited to just 15 minutes, provided by a workforce that is too often undervalued.",504,51320,201505
Labour supports measures to cap the costs of care and will prioritise improving the quality of care services.,504,51320,201505
"Working with local authorities and care providers, Labour will end time-limited 15-minute visits, introducing year-of-care budgets to incentivise better care in the home.",504,51320,201505
"By stopping the use of zero-hours contracts, where regular hours are being worked, we will improve the working life of care workers.",701,51320,201505
"For older people, the normal setting for care should increasingly be the home, not the hospital.",504,51320,201505
"We will recruit 5,000 new home-care workers – a new arm of the NHS – to help care for those with the greatest needs at home.",504,51320,201505
"This will include supporting more people to remain at home at the end of their life, including those who are terminally ill with the greatest care needs.",504,51320,201505
"We will also introduce a system of safety checks to identify risks facing vulnerable older people and enable preventative measures to be put in place, such as grab rails to prevent falling.",504,51320,201505
"The burden of the care crisis is falling on carers, especially women, who account for six in every ten carers.",504,51320,201505
Labour will introduce a new duty on NHS organisations to identify carers so that they can be linked up with the right support.,504,51320,201505
We will ring-fence the money councils get for carers’ breaks to ensure this money gets spent on carers.,504,51320,201505
Labour sees investment in education as an investment both in our children and in the future of the country.,506,51320,201505
"We will protect the entire education budget, including the early years, schools and post-16 education, so that it rises in line with inflation.",506,51320,201505
However investment on its own is not enough.,506,51320,201505
We need to create a route to success for the 50 per cent of young people who do not go down the traditional academic route.,411,51320,201505
"We will raise the standard and status of vocational and technical education, with a high quality vocational route from school through to employment.",411,51320,201505
"The Technical Baccalaureate, a vocational award for 16 to 18-year-olds, will combine a gold-standard qualification accredited by employers, with a quality work placement.",411,51320,201505
"We will transform high performing Further Education colleges with strong links to industry, into new specialist Institutes of Technical Education, with a remit to deliver the Technical Baccalaureate and higher-level skills.",411,51320,201505
We will support more young people to gain the core skills they need for employment and further study.,411,51320,201505
"With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18 and undertake work experience between the ages of 14 and 16.",506,51320,201505
"And to ensure young people are equipped to make the best choices for their future, we will introduce a new, independent system of careers advice, offering personalised face-to-face guidance on routes into university and apprenticeships.",506,51320,201505
We believe fundamentally that a world-class education system is made by excellent teachers.,506,51320,201505
"With Labour, every teacher will need to gain qualified teacher status.",506,51320,201505
We will encourage teaching quality by creating new career routes for teachers who are expert in their subject.,506,51320,201505
These teachers will be able to attain a new ‘Master Teacher’ status.,506,51320,201505
"Teachers will also be expected to update their knowledge and skills as a condition of remaining in the profession, and we will support plans for a new College of Teaching.",506,51320,201505
"These measures will help us close the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers, and work towards all children reading well by age 11.",506,51320,201505
We have supported the successful ‘Teach First’ since its inception and will continue to do so.,506,51320,201505
A new School Leadership Institute will support headteachers and improve school leadership.,506,51320,201505
"It will accredit gold-standard headship qualifications, support leadership training and development, and identify and develop the school leaders of the future.",506,51320,201505
The Government has attempted to oversee thousands of schools from the centre.,506,51320,201505
This approach is not working.,506,51320,201505
Underperformance is going unchallenged and parents do not have enough of a voice.,506,51320,201505
"Labour will introduce new Directors of School Standards at a local level to monitor performance, intervene in underperforming schools and support them to improve.",506,51320,201505
"Where a majority of local parents have concerns about underperformance, or a dip in standards, they will be able to call in their local Director of School Standards to hold a school to account.",506,51320,201505
Labour will promote innovation in schools.,506,51320,201505
We will give all schools freedoms currently only granted to some.,506,51320,201505
"Directors of School Standards will be responsible for commissioning new schools where there is a shortage of school places, encouraging innovative bids from established providers, good local authorities, parents, teachers and entrepreneurs.",506,51320,201505
They will also encourage local schools to work together to improve the quality of education.,506,51320,201505
"We will end the wasteful and poorly performing Free Schools programme, and switch resources to where they are needed, allowing us to cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds at 30 pupils or under.",506,51320,201505
"Private schools currently benefit from generous state subsidies, including business rates relief worth hundreds of millions of pounds.",506,51320,201505
We believe they should do more to contribute to raising standards in state education to justify receiving this subsidy.,506,51320,201505
"As a condition for continued business rate relief, private schools will be required to form a meaningful partnership with a school, or cluster of schools, in the state sector.",506,51320,201505
Children develop and learn best when they are secure and happy.,506,51320,201505
"We need to help our children develop the creativity, self-awareness and emotional skills they need to get on in life.",506,51320,201505
We will introduce compulsory age-appropriate sex and relationships education,506,51320,201505
". We will encourage all schools to embed character education across the curriculum, working with schools to stop the blight of homophobic bullying.",506,51320,201505
"invest £2.5 billion more that the Conservatives to recruit 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives",504,51320,201505
guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours and cancer tests within one week,504,51320,201505
"join up services from home to hospital, with a single point of contact for all who need it",504,51320,201505
"give mental health the same priority as physical health, with a new right to access talking therapies",504,51320,201505
"repeal the Government’s privatisation plans, cap profits and put the right values back at the heart of the NHS",504,51320,201505
"end time-limited 15 minute social care visits and recruit 5,000 new  home-care workers to support people in their home",504,51320,201505
introduce a new gold-standard Technical Baccalaureate for 16 to-18-year olds,411,51320,201505
protect the entire education budget from early years through to post-16 education,506,51320,201505
guarantee all teachers in state schools will be qualified,506,51320,201505
appoint Directors of School Standards to drive up standards in every area,506,51320,201505
"cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds",506,51320,201505
ensure all young people study English and Maths to age 18.,506,51320,201505
"As a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency.",601,51320,201505
"But pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.",606,51320,201505
"Labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong.",606,51320,201505
"We will help to create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.",606,51320,201505
"People’s relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various shapes and sizes, is its bedrock.",604,51320,201505
"But low pay, the pressures of work and caring for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.",503,51320,201505
"We will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in the bank levy.",504,51320,201505
We will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their local primary school.,504,51320,201505
"As well as helping parents, this will provide children with before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations and attainment.",504,51320,201505
"This will be underpinned by a new National Primary Childcare Service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable delivery of quality extracurricular activities.",504,51320,201505
"Labour recognises the vital importance of the power of people’s relationships to build the capacity for love, care and resilience.",606,51320,201505
"We will prioritise early years intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore the role of Sure Start centres as family hubs.",504,51320,201505
"Sure Start will have an obligation to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities and local childcare providers.",504,51320,201505
"More widely, we will encourage local services to co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to integrated early help.",504,51320,201505
"We will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships, and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care, education and health of children.",504,51320,201505
More fathers want to play an active role in their children’s lives and families want to spend more time together with a new baby.,504,51320,201505
"So we will double the current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of paternity pay from £140 to more than £260 a week.",504,51320,201505
"Many grandparents want to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them in doing so.",504,51320,201505
"As a result of this Government’s failures, the commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met.",504,51320,201505
"However, we will never forget how important a decent basic income is to a child’s prospects and wellbeing.",504,51320,201505
"That is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the Office for Budget Responsibility to monitor and report on progress.",504,51320,201505
We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable children,504,51320,201505
and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse.,504,51320,201505
"We will increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued.",504,51320,201505
"We will continue to support Frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and teachers will receive better training for working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.",504,51320,201505
"Britain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.",410,51320,201505
Young people have been priced out of home ownership.,410,51320,201505
"Fewer affordable homes are being built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in the private rented sector.",410,51320,201505
"Everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy.",503,51320,201505
"We will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020 – almost double the current level – by implementing the recommendations of the Lyons Review.",410,51320,201505
It is only by building more homes that people’s aspiration for home ownership will be fulfilled.,410,51320,201505
"Our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live.",301,51320,201505
"To help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in areas of housing growth.",410,51320,201505
And we will unlock a Future Homes Fund by requiring that the billions of pounds saved in Help to Buy ISAs be invested in increasing housing supply.,410,51320,201505
We want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes rather than land banking and speculation.,410,51320,201505
So we will introduce greater transparency in the land market and give local authorities new ‘use it or lose it’ powers to encourage developers to build.,301,51320,201505
"We will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small builders, including through our Help to Build scheme,",403,51320,201505
and by getting the public sector building again.,504,51320,201505
We will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system.,403,51320,201505
"We will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes, including higher council tax on long term empty properties.",403,51320,201505
"And to boost the housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.",410,51320,201505
"For the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises.",403,51320,201505
A ban on unfair letting agent fees will save renters over £600.,403,51320,201505
We will drive standards up by creating a national register of private landlords.,403,51320,201505
Homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis.,503,51320,201505
"Labour reduced homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by 55 per cent.",503,51320,201505
We are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of homelessness and rough sleeping.,503,51320,201505
Britain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides security when people lose their jobs,504,51320,201505
"or fall sick,",504,51320,201505
as well as a decent income when they retire.,504,51320,201505
"The British people have always believed in the principle of contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet, and providing support in times of need.",606,51320,201505
"To guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we need to keep costs under control.",505,51320,201505
"Under this Government, the increase in low pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit, pushing up the social security bill.",701,51320,201505
"To get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes.",403,51320,201505
"We will allow local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that the money is invested in building homes.",403,51320,201505
We will keep the household benefit cap and ask the Social Security Advisory Committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas.,505,51320,201505
"And we will cap structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is properly planned and controlled.",505,51320,201505
Labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of our system.,701,51320,201505
So we will not cut tax credits.,504,51320,201505
"We want everyone who can to have the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs.",701,51320,201505
"We will do more to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers’ Maths, English and IT skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits.",701,51320,201505
They will be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting a job.,701,51320,201505
"We support the principle behind Universal Credit – that there should be a smooth transition into work – but it must be affordable and fit for purpose, so we will pause and review the programme.",701,51320,201505
"There will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out of work for one year,",701,51320,201505
and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for two years.,701,51320,201505
"It will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits.",701,51320,201505
"And we will commission a replacement for the Work Programme at a more local level, working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed.",701,51320,201505
We will introduce a higher rate of Job Seekers Allowance for those who have contributed over years.,504,51320,201505
It will be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify.,505,51320,201505
"Alongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently, and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.",504,51320,201505
"Half a million families have been hit by the Bedroom Tax, and two thirds of those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member.",504,51320,201505
"It is cruel, and we will abolish it.",504,51320,201505
We will reform the Work Capability Assessment and focus it on the support disabled people need to get into work.,504,51320,201505
We will give an independent scrutiny group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it.,504,51320,201505
And we will introduce a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work get more tailored help.,504,51320,201505
"Older people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish, and to enjoy a secure retirement.",504,51320,201505
Older people have contributed all their lives and built the Britain that the next generation  will inherit.,606,51320,201505
"So it is right that they are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health services and a system of care over which they have control.",504,51320,201505
"We will keep the triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest.",504,51320,201505
"And while increases in the state retirement age are necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people have time to plan for changes.",504,51320,201505
"We have taken the tough choice to restrict Winter Fuel Payments for the richest five per cent of pensioners,",505,51320,201505
"but we will guarantee that there will be no additional changes to the Winter Fuel Payments, free TV licences or bus passes for pensioners.",504,51320,201505
"Alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good value for those who have saved.",403,51320,201505
"We will reform the pensions market so that pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement rip-offs.",403,51320,201505
"We support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.",403,51320,201505
"For our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders,",601,51320,201505
"our communities,",606,51320,201505
and in the workplace.,701,51320,201505
"Britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.",403,51320,201505
"Despite the Conservatives’ promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, it is now higher than it was when David Cameron entered Downing Street.",403,51320,201505
Broken promises erode trust.,403,51320,201505
Labour will never cut Britain off from the rest of the world.,601,51320,201505
"Our economy and our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here, including university students coming to study.",607,51320,201505
But the system needs to be controlled and managed so that it is fair.,403,51320,201505
Low-skilled migration has been too high and needs to come down.,403,51320,201505
We need much stronger action to stop illegal immigration.,605,51320,201505
Labour’s plan starts with stronger borders,605,51320,201505
"We will recruit an additional 1,000 borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the UK.",605,51320,201505
"We will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain,",605,51320,201505
and to deport those who commit crimes while they are here.,605,51320,201505
"We will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in and out of the country.",605,51320,201505
"Short-term student visitor visas have dramatically increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse,",605,51320,201505
whilst welcoming overseas university students who bring billions into Britain.,605,51320,201505
And we will keep the cap on workers from outside the EU.,406,51320,201505
"We need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers, which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled migration.",701,51320,201505
Labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting workers.,701,51320,201505
We will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas,605,51320,201505
and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority where there is evidence of abuse.,605,51320,201505
We need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can play their part in British society.,608,51320,201505
"People working in public services, in public facing roles, will be required to speak English.",608,51320,201505
"Those who come here will not be able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being sent to families living abroad.",608,51320,201505
We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively.,605,51320,201505
"We will end the indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system,",201,51320,201505
ending detention for pregnant women,201,51320,201505
and those who have been the victims of sexual abuse or trafficking,201,51320,201505
"And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international obligations,",107,51320,201505
including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from Syria.,107,51320,201505
Crime creates fear and insecurity.,605,51320,201505
"We can only live happy and fulfilled lives if we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person or property.",605,51320,201505
For too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their communities.,605,51320,201505
"Neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of British policing, is at risk of being destroyed.",605,51320,201505
"Anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather than dealt with.",605,51320,201505
"Violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are being caught.",605,51320,201505
Far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the services that are supposed to keep them safe.,605,51320,201505
"Labour believes British policing is at its best when it is rooted in local communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to emergencies.",605,51320,201505
We will protect neighbourhood policing.,605,51320,201505
"By making different choices – to abolish Police and Crime Commissioners,",605,51320,201505
"end the subsidy of firearms licenses,",605,51320,201505
and mandate police forces to work closer together,605,51320,201505
"– we will be able to safeguard over 10,000 police officers for the next three years.",605,51320,201505
"This will be backed up by a new statutory Local Policing Commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood policing in every community.",605,51320,201505
We will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment of local police commanders.,605,51320,201505
"To raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become Chartered Officers, holding a registration with the College of Policing, and able to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be.",605,51320,201505
A new Police Standards Authority will replace the discredited Independent Police Complaints Commission.,605,51320,201505
And we will work with the police to improve ethnic minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they serve.,605,51320,201505
The next part of Labour’s plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place.,605,51320,201505
"We will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions.",605,51320,201505
"And we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with tougher penalties for those who assault them.",605,51320,201505
"The last Labour Government’s reforms of youth justice, which required agencies to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and the numbers of young people in prison.",605,51320,201505
"The next Labour Government will extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders, incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible, divert them into a more constructive way of life.",605,51320,201505
And we will work to embed restorative justice right across the youth justice system.,605,51320,201505
We know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime.,605,51320,201505
"We will ensure drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction,",504,51320,201505
"with proper integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of treatment.",504,51320,201505
"And we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive substances, so called ‘legal highs’.",605,51320,201505
It is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child abuse.,605,51320,201505
"We will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of abuse,",605,51320,201505
and strengthen the vetting and barring regime.,605,51320,201505
"A new child protection unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.",605,51320,201505
We need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people.,605,51320,201505
Labour will do more to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning.,605,51320,201505
Prisons will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and reducing their re-offending.,605,51320,201505
"We will also raise professional standards amongst prison officers, including through the creation of Chartered Prison Officers,",605,51320,201505
and confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.,605,51320,201505
We will enact Britain’s first Victims’ Law to give victims of crime a voice and an entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.,605,51320,201505
Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner.,605,51320,201505
"At least 750,000 children a year witness domestic violence.",605,51320,201505
Stopping violence against women and girls is a priority for Labour.,605,51320,201505
"We will publish a Violence against Women and Girls Bill,",605,51320,201505
"appoint a commissioner to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence,",605,51320,201505
and provide more stable central funding for women’s refuges and Rape Crisis Centres.,605,51320,201505
"We will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a response to domestic violence.",605,51320,201505
"The gun licensing regime will be tightened, so that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an unrestricted license.",605,51320,201505
"And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape suspects have their DNA recorded and stored.",605,51320,201505
Victims of domestic violence need far better support.,605,51320,201505
So we will widen access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.,605,51320,201505
The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing.,605,51320,201505
"Hundreds of British citizens have joined Islamic State – a movement that has engaged in savage violence, and racial and religious hatred.",605,51320,201505
"The British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.",601,51320,201505
"With Labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt and tackle terrorism.",605,51320,201505
The Government were wrong to weaken counter terror powers by scrapping Control Orders.,605,51320,201505
"With Labour, dangerous suspects will be subject to proper controls.",605,51320,201505
Every government department will be engaged in the work of preventing extremism and fighting terrorism.,605,51320,201505
We will implement a much more rigorous strategy for dealing with people returning from the Syrian conflict.,605,51320,201505
"Alongside appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront them with the consequences of their actions.",605,51320,201505
"We will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards that protect people’s privacy.",605,51320,201505
"This is why Labour argued for an independent review, currently being undertaken by David Anderson.",605,51320,201505
We will strengthen the oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.,605,51320,201505
"To defeat the threats of Islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism.",606,51320,201505
The Prevent programme was set up under the last Labour Government to stop young people becoming radicalised.,606,51320,201505
But this Government has cut the funding and narrowed its focus.,606,51320,201505
Much of the work to engage Muslim communities has been lost.,606,51320,201505
"We will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist propaganda,",606,51320,201505
"stopping young people being groomed,",606,51320,201505
and also building resilient institutions for social integration.,608,51320,201505
We applaud those faith communities who have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.,601,51320,201505
"We will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.",605,51320,201505
"We will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in schools, universities or on social media.",503,51320,201505
"And we will strengthen the law on disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.",605,51320,201505
Labour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations and defines our heritage as a nation.,502,51320,201505
The arts allow us to celebrate our common humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. The arts should belong to all and be open to all to take part in.,502,51320,201505
We will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening creative education in schools and after-school clubs.,502,51320,201505
"Institutions that receive arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people,",502,51320,201505
and we will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.,502,51320,201505
"The last Labour Government made admission to our national museums and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people experiencing our greatest cultural treasures.",502,51320,201505
We reaffirm our commitment to universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.,502,51320,201505
Creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy.,502,51320,201505
It is the source of economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal.,502,51320,201505
We will increase the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.,502,51320,201505
"We will create a Prime Minister’s Committee on the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions.",502,51320,201505
The Committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the Prime Minister.,502,51320,201505
Sport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride.,601,51320,201505
"It is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of excellence and strength of character.",606,51320,201505
With a Labour Government our children will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at school.,502,51320,201505
Football clubs are an important part of many people’s identity and sense of belonging.,502,51320,201505
They are more than just businesses.,502,51320,201505
"But despite their importance in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run.",202,51320,201505
Labour will provide the means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs.,202,51320,201505
We will introduce legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the club changes hands.,202,51320,201505
We will also review the role of fan participation in other sports.,202,51320,201505
We will ensure the Premier League delivers on its promise to invest five per cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the grassroots.,502,51320,201505
"We feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife.",501,51320,201505
"Land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they contribute to our sense of identity.",501,51320,201505
"In a globalised world, our local environment provides us with a sense of place and belonging.",501,51320,201505
"As we set out in more detail later on, a Labour Government will play a leading global role in tackling climate change.",501,51320,201505
"However, it will not be enough to simply mitigate the threat of climate change.",501,51320,201505
"We must adapt to its damaging effects, which are impacting on us today.",501,51320,201505
"We will produce an ambitious adaptation programme,",501,51320,201505
and the new Infrastructure Commission will prioritise investment in flood prevention.,501,51320,201505
"We will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.",501,51320,201505
"Labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature, whoever they are, or wherever they live.",501,51320,201505
So we will keep our forests in public ownership,413,51320,201505
and promote access to green spaces in local planning.,501,51320,201505
"We will support the work of the Natural Capital Committee to protect and improve wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our thriving tourism industry.",501,51320,201505
We will build on our strong record on animal welfare – starting with an end to the Government’s ineffective and cruel badger cull.,501,51320,201505
"We will improve the protection of dogs and cats,",501,51320,201505
"ban wild animals in circuses,",501,51320,201505

"We will put in place a long-term strategy for the sector,",703,51320,201505
"promote the best of British produce,",703,51320,201505
"and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of the sector,",703,51320,201505
and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major supermarkets.,703,51320,201505
"extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds,",504,51320,201505
and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm,504,51320,201505

"protect neighbourhood policing by safeguarding over 10,000 frontline police officers over the next three years",605,51320,201505
give football fans a voice in club boardrooms.,202,51320,201505
People who live in this country know that too much power is concentrated in too few hands.,202,51320,201505
"Those who make decisions on behalf of others, whether they are in Westminster, the European Union, in business, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable.",202,51320,201505
"Our over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities, county regions and towns from being able to take control and change things for themselves.",301,51320,201505
We will end a century of centralisation.,301,51320,201505
Labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible when people are given the power to change things for themselves.,301,51320,201505
"Our governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'Westminster knows best approach', and devolve power and decision-making to people and their local communities.",301,51320,201505
From the City of London to Silicon Valley the world’s best industries tend to be clustered geographically.,301,51320,201505
"And too often economic challenges can be too, from our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns.",301,51320,201505
So a Labour government will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic growth and prosperity.,301,51320,201505
"We will reform institutions and devolve power to deal with the causes of our economic problems,",301,51320,201505
and we will encourage local authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.,301,51320,201505
"Instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their insights into what works and what does not.",301,51320,201505
We will promote and encourage a model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.,606,51320,201505
These measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as a union of nations.,301,51320,201505
They will begin to transform the relationship between the citizen and the state.,301,51320,201505
"We will further develop digital government to enable better communication, more collaboration, and sharing of data between services.",303,51320,201505
It will make services and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use.,303,51320,201505
"To create a more connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive, transparent and accountable.",303,51320,201505
"We will continue to back the principle of ‘open data by default’, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.",303,51320,201505
"We will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by May 2016,",202,51320,201505
"and improve the curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they need to play a full part in British society.",202,51320,201505
"We will encourage young people’s volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of ‘Step up to Serve’, and the National Citizens Service.",606,51320,201505
"Drawing on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, we will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does not leave millions unregistered,",202,51320,201505
nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into account the people who live in them.,202,51320,201505
"This will include block registration by universities and care homes,",202,51320,201505
"extending Northern Ireland’s successful Schools Initiative,",202,51320,201505
and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration.,202,51320,201505
Labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.,202,51320,201505
"We will safeguard our democracy by repealing the Lobbying Act, which has gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists.",202,51320,201505
We will ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies.,202,51320,201505
And we will reform the legislative process to strengthen the public’s voice and to better hold the government to account.,202,51320,201505
Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the common good.,601,51320,201505
"But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union now needs to evolve.",204,51320,201505
"As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.",204,51320,201505
"Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions,",204,51320,201505
"to represent every part of the United Kingdom,",202,51320,201505
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber.,202,51320,201505
It is also time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of legislation that only affects England.,204,51320,201505
"This includes the option put forward by Sir William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs.",204,51320,201505
These ideas must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process.,204,51320,201505
We will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our English city and county regions in a hundred years with an English Devolution Act.,301,51320,201505
"It will transfer £30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support.",301,51320,201505
"This will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network.",301,51320,201505
We will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business rates raised from growth in their area.,301,51320,201505
"Fair funding will be restored across England, alongside longer term multi-year budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their area and protect vital services.",301,51320,201505
"And an English Regional Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the relevant Secretaries of State and leaders of our major city and county regions.",301,51320,201505
"In return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish local Public Accounts Committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies creates value for money for local taxpayers.",301,51320,201505
Devolution does not end at town halls.,301,51320,201505
"Local people know best about the complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to solve them.",301,51320,201505
The English New Deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of their public services.,301,51320,201505
"It will support people who need care to live independently,",503,51320,201505
"help troubled families to turn their lives around,",503,51320,201505
and make sure that every child has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.,503,51320,201505
We will give English people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local NHS services.,504,51320,201505
"Patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to hospital services.",504,51320,201505
"We will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and so preserve their local identities.",301,51320,201505
"Councils will be given the power to require particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a single high street.",301,51320,201505
Communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing betting shops – or ban them entirely – in response to local concerns.,301,51320,201505
"In September 2014, people across Scotland voted overwhelmingly for change.",301,51320,201505
Labour will keep its vow and implement the Smith Agreement in full.,301,51320,201505

The new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered by being part of the United Kingdom.,301,51320,201505
"We will maintain the Barnett formula,",301,51320,201505
and Scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across the UK.,301,51320,201505
"Labour will put Welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as Scottish devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically reserved,",301,51320,201505
and that a Welsh legislature is a permanent feature of our constitutional arrangements.,301,51320,201505
"We will take forward proposals from the Silk Commission to extend the power the people of Wales have over their elections, transport and energy.",301,51320,201505
An all-Wales Policing Plan will give the Welsh people the ability to shape local policing in Wales.,301,51320,201505
Wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the Barnett formula.,301,51320,201505
"So while the Conservatives have cut the Welsh budget by £1.5 billion, we will establish a fair funding settlement for Wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.",301,51320,201505
"Labour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, and successive agreements.",106,51320,201505
"A Labour Government will engage proactively with the Northern Ireland Executive to support continued political progress, and deliver on it’s vision of a shared future.",301,51320,201505
We will ensure the economic pact between the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Northern Ireland.,410,51320,201505
We will continue to work with the Irish Government to secure peace in Northern Ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.,106,51320,201505
The Labour Party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination and we will continue to do so.,503,51320,201505
People's differences are not excuses to treat them badly or unjustly.,503,51320,201505
"The next Labour Government will go further in reducing discrimination against women,",503,51320,201505
requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap,503,51320,201505
and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination.,503,51320,201505

"ethnic minorities,",503,51320,201505
and other under-represented groups in politics and public life.,503,51320,201505
"We remain committed to achieving a better balance in Parliament, including through the use of all-women shortlists in Labour Party parliamentary selection contests.",503,51320,201505
We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities.,503,51320,201505
"Our aim is to make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative of our diverse country.",503,51320,201505
"We will also build on our history of championing LGBT rights, tackling homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.",503,51320,201505
"Britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law,",601,51320,201505
"and Labour has a proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting equality and opportunity for all.",503,51320,201505
"Thanks to the Human Rights Act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of redress.",201,51320,201505
"The Conservatives want to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, and abolish the Human Rights Act.",201,51320,201505
"A Labour Government will stand up for citizens’ individual rights, protecting the Human Rights Act and reforming, rather than walking away from, the European Court of Human Rights.",201,51320,201505
"And we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to those that need it.",202,51320,201505
Our Freedom of Information laws have shone a light into the darker corners of government and are a crucial check on the power of the Executive.,202,51320,201505
We will extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are included.,202,51320,201505
And we will repair the damage done by this Government to the vital safeguard offered by judicial review.,202,51320,201505
The free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power.,201,51320,201505
That is why the concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy.,202,51320,201505
No one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion and policy makers.,202,51320,201505
No media company should have so much power that those who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.,202,51320,201505
Yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate.,202,51320,201505
"Labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century media environment.",202,51320,201505
We remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.,201,51320,201505
"We expect the industry to establish a mechanism for independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as set out in the Royal Charter, and agreed by all parties in Parliament.",201,51320,201505
We made a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal.,201,51320,201505
We stand by that promise and will keep it.,201,51320,201505
Our system of public service broadcasting is one of Britain’s great strengths.,601,51320,201505
"The BBC makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life,",502,51320,201505
and we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money.,502,51320,201505
"We will also commit to keeping Channel 4 in public ownership,",413,51320,201505
so it continues to produce vital public content.,502,51320,201505
set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to determine the future of UK’s governance,204,51320,201505
replace the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and Regions,204,51320,201505

"give new powers for communities to shape their high streets, including power over payday lenders and the number of fixed-odds betting terminals",301,51320,201505

ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies,202,51320,201505
require large companies to publish their gender pay gap,503,51320,201505
implement the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.,201,51320,201505
We live in turbulent times.,107,51320,201505
"The rise of ISIL, an aggressive Russia threatening its neighbours in eastern Europe, and continuing economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, are each a challenge to our national security.",104,51320,201505
"Labour is an internationalist party and believes Britain must engage with the global challenges we face, but not try and solve them on our own.",107,51320,201505
"We believe the Conservatives are damaging the interests of our country by turning their backs on Europe, and isolating us abroad.",108,51320,201505
"We will strengthen our national security,",104,51320,201505
"stand up for human rights,",201,51320,201505
"and work with other countries to tackle terrorism,",107,51320,201505
"climate change,",501,51320,201505
and eliminate extreme poverty globally.,107,51320,201505
Britain has a unique influence in the world.,601,51320,201505
"We are the only country that is a member of the UN Security Council, NATO, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth and the EU.",107,51320,201505
"With Labour, Britain’s response to threats to our security will be based on enduring principles.",104,51320,201505
"We will protect our national interests, and strengthen our long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of NATO",104,51320,201505
and the European Union.,108,51320,201505
"We will advance our international engagement, rather than retreating into isolation.",107,51320,201505
"We will maintain the best Armed Forces in the world,",104,51320,201505
capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable security landscape.,104,51320,201505
"And we will support human rights, always putting individual freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.",201,51320,201505
One of our first acts in government will be to conduct a wide-ranging review of Britain’s place in the world and how we can best uphold our values and the national interest.,601,51320,201505
We will take a multilateral approach to global challenges.,107,51320,201505
We will continue to uphold our key alliances.,107,51320,201505
"These include the United States,",101,51320,201505
"our allies in Africa and Latin America,",107,51320,201505
and our partners from across the Commonwealth.,101,51320,201505
They also include the European Union.,108,51320,201505
"The crisis in Ukraine over the past year has demonstrated the importance of NATO and the EU standing up to external threats in Europe’s eastern, and southern neighbourhoods.",104,51320,201505
"Labour will continue to advocate an EU which looks outward to promote stability, peace and prosperity on its borders.",108,51320,201505
Most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism.,104,51320,201505
"ISIL’s barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security.",104,51320,201505
"Following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, it was right that the UK joined other nations in air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq.",104,51320,201505
But military action alone will not defeat ISIL.,105,51320,201505
"A long-term multinational political strategy, with regional actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism across the region.",107,51320,201505
A Labour Government will always do what is necessary to defend our country.,104,51320,201505
"Beyond self-defence, Labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq.",105,51320,201505
We will continue the approach we have taken in this Parliament.,105,51320,201505
"A Labour Government would not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable diplomatic efforts have been exhausted,",105,51320,201505
"the action is proportionate and in partnership with allies,",105,51320,201505
"whether there is a clear legal basis,",105,51320,201505
"and if there is a clear plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.",105,51320,201505
Peace and security in the Middle East are one of Labour’s most important foreign policy objectives.,106,51320,201505
We remain committed to a comprehensive two-state solution – a secure Israel alongside a viable and independent state of Palestine.,106,51320,201505
There can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve.,106,51320,201505
Labour will continue to press for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic resolution.,106,51320,201505
Labour will also continue to honour the UK’s commitment to support Afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement.,107,51320,201505
"In December 2014, the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan ended.",107,51320,201505
We can never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who have sacrificed and risked their lives in Afghanistan to protect our national security.,104,51320,201505
"As power and wealth continues to shift from West to East, our relationship with Asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity.",107,51320,201505
"Labour will set up an Asia Step-Change Taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with regional partners, including China,",107,51320,201505
"both in the commerical realm,",107,51320,201505
"and in other areas, from cultural exchange  to human rights.",201,51320,201505
This commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign policy across the world.,201,51320,201505
We will continue to promote women’s rights.,201,51320,201505
"We will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of poverty and inclusive economic growth.",201,51320,201505
"We will appoint a Global Envoy for Religious Freedom, and establish a multi-faith advisory council on religious freedom within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.",201,51320,201505
"And we will appoint an International LGBT Rights Envoy to promote respect for the human rights of LGBT people,",201,51320,201505
and work towards the decriminalisation of homosexuality worldwide.,201,51320,201505
Labour believes that our membership of the European Union is central to our prosperity and security.,108,51320,201505
"It is why we will work to change the EU, so that it operates in the best interests of our country.",108,51320,201505
And it is why we will re-engage with our European allies to protect our national interest after five years of Britain being sidelined in Europe and isolated abroad.,108,51320,201505
The economic case for membership of the EU is overwhelming.,108,51320,201505
"Over 3 million jobs in the UK are linked to trade with the European Union,",108,51320,201505
and almost half of our trade and foreign investment comes from the EU.,108,51320,201505
"Competing in the single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy.",108,51320,201505
"And it helps boost the living standards of people across Britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and investment.",108,51320,201505
"Our reforms will help deliver a Europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply more austerity and rising unemployment.",108,51320,201505
"` Labour will focus on the completion of the single market and tougher budget discipline,",108,51320,201505
`including on those items where spending at the EU level can save money at the national level.,108,51320,201505
That means driving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy,108,51320,201505
`and a Commission-led zero-based review of spending on EU agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency.,108,51320,201505
"`We will not join the Euro, and we will ensure EU rules protect the interests of non-Euro members.",108,51320,201505
"A Labour Government helped to introduce sensible measures at EU level to protect the rights of British workers, and we remain committed to fighting to protect these measures.",108,51320,201505
"People coming to Britain from the EU to look for work are expected to contribute to our economy, and to our society.",108,51320,201505
` So we will secure reforms to immigration,108,51320,201505
"and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls, which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer when new countries join.",108,51320,201505
"We will also continue to open up EU decision-making, and implement institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among European citizens.",108,51320,201505
"We will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over European legislation, by arguing for a ‘red-card mechanism’ for member states, providing greater parliamentary scrutiny.",108,51320,201505
Labour’s priority in government will be protecting the NHS,504,51320,201505
and tackling the cost-of-living crisis.,409,51320,201505
It is not to take Britain out of Europe.,108,51320,201505
"However, Labour will legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers from Britain to the European Union without the consent of the British public through an in/out referendum.",202,51320,201505
The primary duty of any government is the defence of the nation and its interests.,104,51320,201505
"That is why Labour is committed to ensuring the UK has responsive, high-tech Armed Forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnected threats, in an unpredictable security landscape.",104,51320,201505
"We will conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of government, with an inclusive national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country.",104,51320,201505
"It will be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that impede our Armed Forces from effective response to threats.",104,51320,201505
"At the heart of our defence policy are the service men and women, both regulars and reservists, who risk their lives for their country.",104,51320,201505
"Labour will strengthen the covenant between our nation and our Armed Forces, veterans and their families.",104,51320,201505
We will create a Veterans’ Register to make certain our veterans receive proper support on leaving service.,104,51320,201505
"We will continue to roll out Labour’s Veterans’ Interview Programme, in which companies voluntarily guarantee an interview for job-seeking ex-forces personnel.",104,51320,201505
"We will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members of our Armed Forces illegal,",503,51320,201505
and we will enshrine the Military Covenant in the NHS Constitution.,104,51320,201505
"The UK defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with a turnover of £22 billion a year.",104,51320,201505
"We will work to secure defence jobs across the UK,",104,51320,201505
protect the supply chain and support industry to grow Britain’s defence exports.,104,51320,201505
"In partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money, interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.",104,51320,201505
Britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks.,104,51320,201505
"We have already called on the Government to require every company working with the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign up to a cyber-security charter.",104,51320,201505
This would reduce the risk of hackers using small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the department itself.,104,51320,201505
"We will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national infrastructure.",104,51320,201505
"Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear capability, delivered through a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent.",104,51320,201505
"We will actively work to increase momentum on global multilateral disarmament efforts and negotiations,",105,51320,201505
and look at further reductions in global stockpiles and the numbers of weapons.,105,51320,201505
We will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy.,501,51320,201505
"As the terrible impact of the floods in Britain showed last year, climate change is now an issue of national, as well as global security.",501,51320,201505
"From record droughts in California, to devastating typhoons in the Philippines, the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future generations would experience.",501,51320,201505
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that if the world is going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally-agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this century.",501,51320,201505
"The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the reductions will need to be later.",501,51320,201505
"The effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest.",501,51320,201505
"If we do not tackle climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty.",501,51320,201505
"We will expand the role of the Department of International Development to mitigate the risks of a changing climate,",501,51320,201505
and support sustainable livelihoods for the world’s poorest people.,416,51320,201505
"We want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the UNFCCC conference in Paris, in December.",501,51320,201505
"We will make the case for ambitious emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two degree goal.",501,51320,201505
"And we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century,",501,51320,201505
"for transparent and universal rules for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions,",501,51320,201505
and for an equitable deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in combatting climate change.,501,51320,201505
We are proud that Labour MPs passed the historic law that commits Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development.,107,51320,201505
"Labour will use that commitment from the British public to transform the lives of the world’s poorest people, whilst ensuring value for taxpayers’ money.",107,51320,201505
"We will work in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those affected by violence,",107,51320,201505
prioritising the protection and education of women and children.,107,51320,201505
We will rebalance the budget to focus funding on the world’s poorest countries.,107,51320,201505
"While progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals, it is unacceptable that over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day.",107,51320,201505
"We will work with other countries at this year’s Sustainable Development Goals Summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty,",107,51320,201505

and ensure good governance.,107,51320,201505
"We will work with companies to ensure they have sustainable supply chains that are free from slavery, treat their workers fairly, and pay taxes where they are due.",107,51320,201505
conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of government,104,51320,201505
"return Britain to a leadership role in Europe, but reform the EU so that it works for Britain",108,51320,201505

push for an ambitious target in Paris to get to goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century.,501,51320,201505
Time for change  In this election the country has a choice.,503,51320,201505
"Either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in the City of London but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country.",503,51320,201505
A country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents and an NHS under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.,504,51320,201505
"Or we can change direction, together, with Labour.",503,51320,201505
We don't promise the earth.,503,51320,201505
"All our commitments in this manifesto are fully funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.",414,51320,201505
But our policies will bring hope and make Britain work for working people once again.,403,51320,201505
Working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills.,701,51320,201505
Families want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare.,503,51320,201505
Mothers and fathers want a better future for their children.,503,51320,201505
Individuals and communities in every part of our country want to have control over their lives,301,51320,201505
and for those in power to be held to account.,202,51320,201505
"Everyone, young and old, wants a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.",606,51320,201505
"We deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the top.",503,51320,201505
That's what this manifesto offers.,503,51320,201505
It is the kind of country we know we have it in ourselves to be.,503,51320,201505
Let's build it together.,503,51320,201505
A sustainable and prosperous economy will unlock the solutions to a number of long term socioeconomic problems which are holding us back.,410,51340,201505
"In this manifesto we will set out how we propose to address major issues in health, education, financing our public services and protecting those who are genuinely in need.",408,51340,201505
"However, all of this becomes more achievable in a prosperous Northern Ireland.",410,51340,201505
"The best contributor to mental and physical wellbeing, the best counter to long term sickness, is to equip people with the skills they need to secure a job that a prosperous economy will provide.",410,51340,201505
"Balanced, sustained prosperity can assist in changing the lives of so many people who currently feel left behind by society,",410,51340,201505
by the political process,202,51340,201505
and by the economy.,503,51340,201505
It is the reason the SDLP is highlighting the need for a new Prosperity Process.,410,51340,201505
The SDLP has for many years supported the devolution of corporation tax powers.,301,51340,201505
"However, corporation tax on its own will not bring the growth we need.",410,51340,201505
We must seek access to all the tools we need to repair our economy.,410,51340,201505
If we are to attract high quality jobs through inward investment then we need to ensure we have a suitably qualified skills pool to take up these opportunities.,411,51340,201505
We also need to address urgently infrastructure imbalances to ensure that economic growth is not centred exclusively on Belfast but is regionally balanced.,411,51340,201505
"We recognise the new challenges that increased fiscal powers will bring, not least the potential variance of the Northern Ireland block grant, but we believe our abilities are more than enough for this challenge.",301,51340,201505
The SDLP believe this major step can set the local economy on a new trajectory.,301,51340,201505
Only full control of our finances will allow us to have full control of our future.,301,51340,201505
The Northern Ireland economy is unbalanced and our private sector is underdeveloped.,410,51340,201505

"The SDLP will establish, in partnership with the British government, a Scottish style commission to begin the devolution of further powers which will allow us to take control of additional fiscal levers.",301,51340,201505
Through this mechanism Scotland has succeeded in winning the argument to allow them to borrow money and issue their own bonds.,301,51340,201505

The SDLP recognise the enormous potential of tourism to stimulate Northern Ireland’s economy,410,51340,201505
and to create much needed jobs.,701,51340,201505
Reduce the rate of Northern Ireland’s VAT rate to 5% in the tourism and hospitality sectors.,402,51340,201505

Education is also key to achieving both social justice and longterm prosperity.,503,51340,201505
However our current educational system is failing both our children and our society.,506,51340,201505

"Furthermore the SDLP is calling for an Executive programme fund to be established to initiate a longterm, crossdepartmental preventative health strategy.",504,51340,201505
In this way a meaningful process can be embarked upon that will address the stark health inequalities here in a consistent way.,504,51340,201505

We will have the vision and the courage to take a longer term view of how health is both resourced and administered in the North and on an allIreland basis.,504,51340,201505
This is an area where ‘joined up Government’ has to be more than an empty phrase.,504,51340,201505
A successful Prosperity Process will unlock government resources and assist individuals to address their own long term mental and physical wellbeing.,504,51340,201505

We see a need to license landlords and letting agents to ensure they are fully informed of their responsibilities and duties.,403,51340,201505
This would also protect and enhance their relationships with their tenants.,403,51340,201505

Cancel the boundary review due to report in 2018.,202,51421,201505

We will also remove the discrimination against third parties by requiring political parties to include the cost of staffing in their national expense limits in the same way as third parties now do.,202,51421,201505

"And in the last months, we have given the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the power to lower the voting age to 16.",301,51421,201505

The Scottish Parliament should raise in tax more than half of what it spends in its budget.,301,51421,201505
"A Scottish welfare system should allow the Scottish Parliament to change the benefits regime where there is specific Scottish need or priority, with a starting budget of around £3 billion.",301,51421,201505
These powers and more will deliver for the Scottish people: an empowered and accountable Scottish Parliament,202,51421,201505
in a strong and secure United Kingdom.,202,51421,201505
We will deliver Home Rule for Scotland by implementing the Smith Commission proposals in full in the first session of the next Parliament.,204,51421,201505

"We endorse the recent St. David’s Day announcement and will implement it in full, devolving powers over energy, ports, local elections, broadcasting and more, and implementing a reserved powers model.",301,51421,201505

and devolving the power to amend electoral arrangements for the Assembly and local elections in Wales with a two thirds majority.,301,51421,201505
Giving the Children’s Commissioner for Wales the power to examine issues that affect children in Wales but are not within the control of the Welsh Government.,301,51421,201505

We will work constructively with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government to ensure the political stability of the Northern Ireland Assembly and other institutions of the Belfast Agreement.,202,51421,201505
"To grow the economy, tackle social exclusion, overcome inequality and deliver efficiencies in public services, Liberal Democrats will support policies and initiatives that promote sharing over separation and counter the cost of division.",202,51421,201505
A key aspect of this is dealing with the legacy of the past.,106,51421,201505
"The Stormont House Agreement represents another stage in the intensive work necessary to build long-term peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland.",106,51421,201505
In Government we delivered on the commitment to enable the devolution of Corporation Tax to Northern Ireland by April 2017.,301,51421,201505
We will continue to work with all parties to implement the full package of measures in the Stormont House Agreement and address outstanding issues.,301,51421,201505
We will build on this by: Keeping under review the prospect of further devolution of fiscal powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly,301,51421,201505

Working with the political parties in Northern Ireland to tackle the cost of division and ensuring all Government policies in Northern Ireland support the aim of a genuine Shared Future for all.,202,51421,201505
"Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK Parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.",204,51421,201505
"It is possible that a future UK government could use the support of MPs representing Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland to secure the passage of legislation that only affects England, even if the majority in England were opposed.",204,51421,201505
This would be a key issue for our proposed Constitutional Convention to address.,204,51421,201505
"Liberal Democrats believe an English-only stage in legislation affecting England should be considered, so English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.",204,51421,201505
"However, this would need to be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance of opinion in England, not the distorted picture generated by the First Past the Post system.",202,51421,201505
"Beyond Parliament, there is much to change to improve the way communities in England are governed.",301,51421,201505

Any changes must balance the objectives of more local autonomy and fair equalisation between communities.,202,51421,201505
"In some areas of England there is an even greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach.",301,51421,201505
"We will therefore introduce Devolution on Demand, enabling even greater devolution of powers from Westminster to Councils or groups of Councils working together – for example to a Cornish Assembly.",301,51421,201505
The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs with regard to funding.,301,51421,201505
The Barnett Formula is the mechanism used to adjust spending allocations across the UK.,301,51421,201505
The Liberal Democrats have already delivered a substantial extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will devolve further fiscal powers to the devolved governments.,301,51421,201505
"In order to ensure reliable funding, we will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for future spending allocations for Scotland and Northern Ireland.",301,51421,201505
This will protect the individual nations’ budgets from external shocks like the recent global drop in the price of oil.,301,51421,201505
We recognise the findings of the Holtham Commission that the current formula underfunds Wales and will commission work to update this analysis.,301,51421,201505
"We will address the imbalance by immediately entrenching a Barnett floor set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly,",301,51421,201505
and seek over a Parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level.,301,51421,201505
"To lead a fulfilled life, people need power over more than just their government.",202,51421,201505

"We recognise the importance of a plural and diverse media, free from state influence or from monopolistic or dominant market control, in guaranteeing a vibrant national conversation.",201,51421,201505

"We will: Give lead responsibility to Ofcom and enable it to conduct reviews periodically, as well as when triggered by proposed mergers and acquisitions,",201,51421,201505
and enable Ofcom to set down conditions to prevent the reach of any media company damaging the public interest.,201,51421,201505

"Use a variety of measures to ensure that there is a vibrant local and ‘hyperlocal’ media to help inform citizens about their local area and their local politics, including: Redirecting the current subsidies for ‘local TV’, which have failed to contribute significantly to cultural life.",202,51421,201505

Liberal Democrats are internationalists because we respect the rights of human beings wherever they live and understand that by working together countries can achieve more than they can alone.,107,51421,201505

"Your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital, your pension – all these things depend on a strong economy.",408,51620,201505
So we will carry on working through our long-term economic plan.,404,51620,201505
We will:keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts,414,51620,201505
"increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500",503,51620,201505
"and the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000",503,51620,201505
"commit to no increases in VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax",503,51620,201505
crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do,403,51620,201505
"rebalance our economy,",414,51620,201505
build a Northern Powerhouse,410,51620,201505
and back elected metro mayors,301,51620,201505
pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.,404,51620,201505
Our long-term economic plan is turning around Britain’s economy.,404,51620,201505
"Five years ago, Britain was reeling from the chaos of Labour’s Great Recession;",404,51620,201505
in 2014 we were the fastest growing of all the major advanced economies,404,51620,201505
"– last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the Eurozone and seven times faster than France.",404,51620,201505
"Five years ago, the budget deficit was more than 10 per cent of GDP, the highest in our peacetime history, and the national debt was rising out of control;",414,51620,201505
"today, the deficit is half that level",414,51620,201505
and debt as a share of national income will start falling this financial year.,414,51620,201505
Industries are coming back to life.,410,51620,201505
Companies are striding into new markets.,410,51620,201505
Manufacturers are returning to our shores.,410,51620,201505
More tech companies are starting up here than anywhere else in Europe.,410,51620,201505
We have overtaken France as the third largest car producer in Europe,410,51620,201505
"and there are 760,000 more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating wealth across the country.",410,51620,201505
"The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival,",410,51620,201505
"which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day:",701,51620,201505
more than the rest of the European Union combined.,410,51620,201505
This is no accident.,404,51620,201505
It is the product of hard work by people in every part of the country and it is thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan.,404,51620,201505
"By halving the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the economy.",414,51620,201505
"By maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be.",414,51620,201505
"And by establishing the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), we have ended – permanently – the ability of politicians to cook the books for political gain at the nation’s expense.",304,51620,201505
"With inflation at a record low,",404,51620,201505
"the latest OBR forecasts show that living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010,",404,51620,201505
"and are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade, with the average family £900 better off.",404,51620,201505
"It is only by securing the recovery,",414,51620,201505
dealing with our debts,414,51620,201505
and creating jobs,701,51620,201505
that we can continue to raise living standards.,503,51620,201505
That means sticking to our long-term economic plan; Britain is on the right path.,404,51620,201505
But the job is not finished.,404,51620,201505
There are clouds on the international horizon.,404,51620,201505
Huge challenges remain at home.,414,51620,201505
"We have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per cent of GDP, but that is still too high.",414,51620,201505
"Our trade with emerging economies is up, with exports to China more than doubled since 2009,",410,51620,201505
but overall we are still too dependent on slow-growing European markets.,410,51620,201505
"Business investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared to other countries.",410,51620,201505
Productivity remains too low.,410,51620,201505
"And while prosperity is now spreading around the country, our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on financial services.",410,51620,201505
We will finish the job we started in a balanced way.,414,51620,201505
Those with the broadest shoulders have contributed the most to deficit reduction,414,51620,201505
"– which is why inequality has fallen,",503,51620,201505
and child and pensioner poverty are down – and they will continue to do so.,503,51620,201505
We will increase NHS spending every year.,504,51620,201505
"We will control spending,",414,51620,201505
"eliminate the deficit,",414,51620,201505
and start to run a surplus.,414,51620,201505
"We will go from stuck in the red, to back in the black.",414,51620,201505
"By building on the foundations we have put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be able to pursue our ambition for Britain to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.",410,51620,201505
"If we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made in the last five years.",404,51620,201505
More borrowing – and the extra debt interest that it brings – means there is less money to spend on schools and hospitals.,414,51620,201505
"More spending means higher taxes for hardworking people,",414,51620,201505
"and interest rates that are higher than they otherwise would be – punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobs.",414,51620,201505
And failing to control our debt would be more than an economic failing; it would be a moral failing – leaving our children and grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repay.,414,51620,201505
So you face a clear choice.,404,51620,201505
"Economic competence, with David Cameron as Prime Minister, following through on our long-term economic plan.",404,51620,201505
"Or economic chaos under Labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more secure economy.",404,51620,201505
We will finish the job by eliminating the deficit to keep our economy secure and keep your taxes and mortgage payments down,414,51620,201505
Our long-term economic plan reflects our values:,404,51620,201505
we as a nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable levels of debt to the next generation.,414,51620,201505
We will eliminate the deficit in a sensible and balanced way,414,51620,201505
that will enable us to continue to increase spending on the NHS,504,51620,201505
and cut Income Tax for 30 million working people.,701,51620,201505
Our deficit reduction plan has two phases.,414,51620,201505
"The first will see us continue to reduce government spending by one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full financial years of the next Parliament, the same rate as over the last five years.",414,51620,201505
That means saving £1 a year in every £100 that government spends.,414,51620,201505
"We don’t think there’s a business that couldn’t do that – and we don’t think government, when it is spending your money, should be any different.",414,51620,201505
"That will require a further £30 billion in fiscal consolidation over the next two years,",414,51620,201505
on top of the £120 billion that we have already identified and delivered over this Parliament.,414,51620,201505
"We will find £13 billion from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction as in this Parliament.",414,51620,201505
"We will find £12 billion from welfare savings,",505,51620,201505
on top of the £21 billion of savings delivered in this Parliament.,414,51620,201505
"And we will raise at least £5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning,",414,51620,201505
building on the £7 billion of annual savings we have delivered in this Parliament.,414,51620,201505
"This £30 billion of further consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps falling as a share of GDP and to deliver a balanced structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new fiscal mandate that Parliament voted on earlier this year.",414,51620,201505
Our commitment goes further than this.,414,51620,201505
"A balanced current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable reduction in our level of national debt, which remains far too high in a world of continuing economic challenges.",414,51620,201505
International evidence and Treasury analysis shows that the only way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus.,414,51620,201505
Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.,414,51620,201505
"That is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus, with the Government taking in more than it is spending for the first time in 18 years.",414,51620,201505
That means we can start properly paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual interest payments – reducing the UK’s vulnerability to future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining.,414,51620,201505
"We will achieve this by continuing to control government spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but instead growing it in line with inflation.",414,51620,201505
"From 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved, spending will grow in line with GDP.",414,51620,201505
"A new fundamental principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent OBR, will ensure that in normal economic times, when the economy is growing, the government will always run a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep our economy secure,",414,51620,201505
with a state neither smaller than we need nor bigger than we can afford.,404,51620,201505
"Total government spending as a share of our national income at the end of the next Parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher than in the year 2000, the year before Labour lost all control of spending and the national debt started its longest rise for hundreds of years.",414,51620,201505
"Our approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending, making savings in welfare,",505,51620,201505
and continuing to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance.,403,51620,201505
"This means that we can commit to no increases in VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance.",404,51620,201505
"Tax rises on working people would harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost jobs.",404,51620,201505
"Instead, as we reduce the deficit,",414,51620,201505
"we will cut Income Tax, as we have done over the last five years:",404,51620,201505
"during the next Parliament, we will increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500",404,51620,201505
"and the higher rate threshold to £50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned money.",404,51620,201505
"We will continue to build a stronger, safer and more secure banking system that serves its customers and provides businesses with the finance they need to grow",414,51620,201505
and create jobs,701,51620,201505
We will make sure our financial services industry is the best regulated in the world with our new system of supervision led by the independent Bank of England.,414,51620,201505
Our new Financial Policy Committee will monitor and control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across the whole economy– a vital task that was totally ignored in the run up to the financial crisis.,414,51620,201505
Our tough new Financial Conduct Authority will protect consumers and ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the whole economy.,403,51620,201505
"To protect hardworking taxpayers from future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring-fencing banks’ high street branches from their investment arms by 2019 at the latest.",403,51620,201505
"In order to ensure that new pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short-termism, we will ensure that Britain continues to have the toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any financial centre.",403,51620,201505
We will continue to sell the Government’s stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societies in order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and support the economy.,401,51620,201505
Hardworking taxpayers supported the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks should in turn support them during the recovery – that is why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict established banks’ ability to pay less tax by offsetting their profits against past losses.,403,51620,201505
Our plan is to ensure banks help secure our recovery and back businesses to create jobs and growth in our economy.,414,51620,201505
"We capped payday lenders, made it easier for you to switch your bank account and will continue to support the credit union movement in making financial services more accessible.",403,51620,201505
We will continue the successful Funding for Lending scheme into 2016.,403,51620,201505
"We will help new and existing challenger banks to inject fresh competition into the market for personal current accounts, mortgages and business loans, including through the British Business Bank,",403,51620,201505
while backing the financial technology revolution.,411,51620,201505
We will improve our support for investment into start-ups,403,51620,201505
"and roll-out our innovative Help to Grow scheme, which will plug a £1 billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand, invest",403,51620,201505
and take on new employees.,701,51620,201505
Tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning is an important part of our long-term economic plan.,404,51620,201505
"We will increase the annual tax charges paid by those with non-domiciled status,",403,51620,201505
"ensuring that they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and continue to tackle abuses of this status.",414,51620,201505
"We will lead international efforts to ensure global companies pay their fair share in tax,",403,51620,201505
"as David Cameron did at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, which secured significant international progress on fairer tax rules and full transparency over who really owns companies.",403,51620,201505
We will push for all countries to sign up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;,403,51620,201505
review the implementation of the new international country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the case for making this information publicly available on a multilateral basis.,403,51620,201505
We will ensure developing countries have full access to global automatic tax information exchange systems and continue to build the capacity of tax authorities in developing countries.,403,51620,201505
"We are also making it a crime if companies fail to put in place measures to stop economic crime, such as tax evasion, in their organisations",605,51620,201505
and making sure that the penalties are large enough to punish and deter.,605,51620,201505
"We are committed to a truly national recovery, benefiting all parts of our country.",601,51620,201505
"We have devolved powers to Scotland and Wales,",301,51620,201505
"and set out long-term economic plans to raise the growth rate of all parts of England, bringing areas which have grown more slowly up to at least the national average.",404,51620,201505
"Over the last year, the North grew faster than the South.",410,51620,201505
"By connecting up the North with modern transport links, we will enable its great cities and towns to pool their strengths.",410,51620,201505
We will invest a record £13 billion in transport for the North.,411,51620,201505
"We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern Hub, and provide new trains for the North.",411,51620,201505
"We will upgrade the A1, M62, M1 and A555 link road.",411,51620,201505
"And that is on top of our £50 billion commitment to build High Speed 2 – the new North-South railway linking up London with the West Midlands, Leeds and Manchester",411,51620,201505
– and develop High Speed 3 to join up the North.,411,51620,201505
We will back scientific and technical strengths by creating new institutions such as Health North;,411,51620,201505
"the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield;",411,51620,201505
the National Centre for Ageing Science and Innovation in Newcastle;,411,51620,201505
the Cognitive Computing centre at Daresbury;,411,51620,201505
"and by making investments in energy research in Blackpool, Cumbria and Thornton.",411,51620,201505
"To help attract growth and new businesses we will improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5, A358, A30 and A303,",411,51620,201505
and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line – bringing new fast trains on the route.,411,51620,201505
We will invest to boost tourism in the South West,404,51620,201505
and ensure the world-class defence assets and cyber-security industries of the South West benefit the local economy.,404,51620,201505
"We will back business by investing a record £5.2 billion in better transport,",411,51620,201505
"upgrading the M1 and M6,",411,51620,201505
and electrifying the Midland Main Line from St Pancras to Sheffield,411,51620,201505
"–putting the Midlands at the centre of a modern, inter-connected transport network for the UK.",411,51620,201505
"We will back the Midlands’ strength in advanced manufacturing, engineering and science with major projects such as the Energy Research Accelerator",411,51620,201505
and support for innovation in the motor industry.,411,51620,201505
"We will improve rail connections to East Anglia, delivering ‘Norwich in 90 minutes’ and ‘Ipswich in 60 minutes’",411,51620,201505
and upgrade key roads like the A11 and A47.,411,51620,201505
We will support the creation of new jobs,701,51620,201505
"by backing the East’s great strengths – agri-tech, high-tech businesses around Cambridge,",411,51620,201505
and energy businesses at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.,411,51620,201505
"We will devolve far-reaching powers over economic development, transport and social care to large cities which choose to have elected mayors.",301,51620,201505
"We will legislate to deliver the historic deal for Greater Manchester, which will devolve powers and budgets and lead to the creation of a directly elected Mayor for Greater Manchester.",301,51620,201505
"In Cambridgeshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire East, we will pilot allowing local councils to retain 100 per cent of growth in business rates, so they reap the benefit of decisions that boost growth locally.",301,51620,201505
We will devolve further powers over skills spending and planning to the Mayor of London.,301,51620,201505
"And we will deliver more bespoke Growth Deals with local councils, where locally supported,",301,51620,201505
and back Local Enterprise Partnerships to promote jobs and growth.,301,51620,201505
You depend on infrastructure at every stage of your life:,411,51620,201505
"to go to school, to go to work, to enable businesses to grow and create jobs for your children and grandchildren.",411,51620,201505
"We have a plan of action that will improve our roads, railways, airports and internet connections. We will:",411,51620,201505
invest in infrastructure to attract businesses and good jobs across the whole of the UK,411,51620,201505
"make your life easier, with more and faster trains, more roads and cycle routes",411,51620,201505

"roll out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is part of the digital economy.",411,51620,201505
"Under Labour, road and rail were starved of resources,",411,51620,201505
while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide.,411,51620,201505
"This meant packed trains, potholes, patchy broadband coverage – businesses held back and cities left behind.",411,51620,201505
Turning these problems around takes time.,411,51620,201505
"But because we have made savings elsewhere, we have been able to make significant investments in infrastructure.",411,51620,201505
"We will commit, alongside running a surplus, to increase our capital spending – investment in infrastructure – at least in line with our national income.",411,51620,201505
We have set out a plan to invest over £100 billion in our infrastructure over the next Parliament.,411,51620,201505
"This will fund the biggest investment in rail since Victorian times,",411,51620,201505
and the most extensive improvements to our roads since the 1970s.,411,51620,201505
And it will give us the most comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband coverage of any major European country.,411,51620,201505
"Overall public investment will be higher on average over this decade, as a percentage of GDP, than under the whole period of the last Labour Government.",411,51620,201505
We will deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond to the Airports Commission’s final report.,411,51620,201505
We will invest £38 billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019.,411,51620,201505
"Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme, with work already underway across the North, the Midlands, and South Wales;",411,51620,201505
"there are plans to go further in the rest of the country, including East Anglia and the South West.",411,51620,201505
"In addition to rolling out our national high-speed rail network, with High Speed 2 and High Speed 3,",411,51620,201505
"we will complete the construction of the new east-west Crossrail across Greater London,",411,51620,201505
"and push forward with plans for Crossrail 2, a new rail route running through London and connecting Surrey and Hertfordshire.",411,51620,201505
We will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters:,403,51620,201505
we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament,412,51620,201505
"– regulated fares will only be able to rise by Retail Price Inflation, and train operating companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices above this.",412,51620,201505
We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-time season tickets and require train companies to improve compensation arrangements for passengers when trains are more than a few minutes late.,403,51620,201505
"We are investing millions of pounds in fitting out trains with new wi-fi equipment and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit passengers on trains across England and Wales.",411,51620,201505
"We abolished Labour’s fuel duty escalator, and instead have frozen fuel duty, delivering the longest duty freeze in 20 years.",412,51620,201505
We will invest £15 billion in roads.,411,51620,201505
"This will include over £6 billion in the northern road network, with the dualling and widening of the A1 north of Newcastle and the first new trans-Pennine road capacity in over 40 years.",411,51620,201505
"We will take action to tackle some of the most notorious and longstanding problems on our road network, including improvements to the A303, A47 and A27.",411,51620,201505
"We will add 1,300 extra lane miles to our roads,",411,51620,201505
"improve over 60 problem junctions,",411,51620,201505
and continue to provide enough funding to fix around 18 million potholes nationwide between 2015 and 2021.,411,51620,201505
Our aim is for almost every car and van to be a zero emission vehicle by 2050,501,51620,201505
– and we will invest £500 million over the next five years to achieve it.,501,51620,201505
We want to double the number of journeys made by bicycle,501,51620,201505

and we will ensure no one is left behind by subsidising the cost of installing superfast capable satellite services in the very hardest to reach areas.,411,51620,201505
We will also release more spectrum from public sector use to allow greater private sector access.,411,51620,201505
And we have set an ambition that ultrafast broadband should be available to nearly all UK premises as soon as practicable.,411,51620,201505
We will hold the mobile operators to their new legally binding agreement to ensure that 90 per cent of the UK landmass will have voice and SMS coverage by 2017.,403,51620,201505
We will continue to invest in mobile infrastructure to deliver coverage for voice calls and text messages for the final 0.3 – 0.4 per cent of UK premises that do not currently have it.,411,51620,201505
"We will ensure that Britain seizes the chance to be a world leader in the development of 5G, playing a key role in defining industry standards.",601,51620,201505
"Whatever stage of life you are at – whether you’re looking for your first job out of school, or coming to the end of your career – we will work to help you enjoy the satisfaction and rewards of a decent job.",701,51620,201505
"We will: help businesses to create two million new jobs, so we achieve full employment",701,51620,201505
give businesses the most competitive taxes of any major economy,402,51620,201505
back small firms with a major business rates review,402,51620,201505

"If you want to live in the most vibrant and dynamic country in the world, this election matters.",601,51620,201505
"Only the Conservatives have the vision, the optimism, the ambition and the discipline to transform Britain.",601,51620,201505
That’s because we know that a decent job is the best weapon against poverty and the best way to provide security for families.,701,51620,201505
"Thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan, Britain is creating more jobs than the 27 other countries of the European Union put together.",404,51620,201505
That means more people with the security of a regular pay packet.,404,51620,201505
"Over the past five years, 1.9 million new jobs have been created;",701,51620,201505
"1,000 jobs for every single day that we have been in government.",701,51620,201505
This represents a transformation in many people’s lives;,701,51620,201505
giving families more security;,701,51620,201505
boosting the self-esteem of young people taken on;,706,51620,201505
and providing hope for those who have been unemployed for years.,701,51620,201505
But we need to go further.,404,51620,201505
"We have set out the bold aim of achieving full employment, with the highest employment rate of any major economy.",404,51620,201505
We want Britain to be the best place in the world to start a business,402,51620,201505
and will create another two million jobs over the next Parliament.,701,51620,201505
"We will abolish long-term youth unemployment, and make sure that all young people are either earning or learning.",404,51620,201505
"And we will make our economy more inclusive, by removing barriers that stop women and disabled people from participating in our workforce.",503,51620,201505
"To achieve this, we will back British businesses:",402,51620,201505

"With the Conservatives, Britain will be the best place in Europe to innovate, patent new ideas and set up and expand a business.",402,51620,201505
We aim to be number one in Europe,402,51620,201505
and in the top five worldwide in the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings by 2020,402,51620,201505
and to lead Europe in attracting foreign investment.,402,51620,201505
Backing business also means helping our farmers and our rural communities.,703,51620,201505
"Neglected for 13 years under Labour, we have started the process of championing and connecting up the countryside.",703,51620,201505
"In the coming years, we will go further, helping our farmers,",703,51620,201505
supporting British food around the world,703,51620,201505
and opening up new export markets.,703,51620,201505
This is all at risk if the Labour Party forms the government.,305,51620,201505
"Their policies to spend more, borrow more and tax more would be catastrophic for Britain’s businesses – and for all the families thrown back into the despair of joblessness and financial uncertainty.",305,51620,201505
We have already delivered 2.2 million new apprenticeships over the last five years.,411,51620,201505
"Over the next five years, we will deliver three million more and ensure they deliver the skills employers need.",411,51620,201505
"We aim to achieve full employment in the UK,",701,51620,201505
"with the highest employment rate in the G7,",701,51620,201505
and we will help businesses create two million jobs over the Parliament.,701,51620,201505
We have abolished the jobs tax – employers' National Insurance contributions (NICs) – for the under 21s,402,51620,201505
and next year we will do the same for young apprentices under 25.,402,51620,201505
"We will continue to help smaller businesses take on new workers through the Employment Allowance, which frees businesses from the first £2,000 of employers’ NICs so that a third of employers pay no jobs tax.",402,51620,201505
"Our economic plan has helped deliver sharp falls in long-term youth unemployment, taking the numbers of 16–18 year-olds not in education, employment or training to historic lows.",404,51620,201505
"We will provide support to those 16 –17 year olds still not in education, employment or training and to those who risk becoming so.",404,51620,201505
Jobcentre Plus advisers will work with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships.,404,51620,201505
"But it is not fair – on taxpayers, or on young people themselves – that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to their community.",505,51620,201505
So we will introduce tougher Day One Work Requirements for young people claiming out-of-work benefits.,505,51620,201505
"We will replace the Jobseeker’s Allowance for 18-21 year-olds with a Youth Allowance that will be time-limited to six months, after which young people will have to take an apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work for their benefits.",505,51620,201505
It is also not fair that taxpayers should have to pay for 18-21 year-olds on Jobseeker’s Allowance to claim Housing Benefit in order to leave home.,505,51620,201505
So we will ensure that they no longer have an automatic entitlement to Housing Benefit.,505,51620,201505
"To support jobs, we cut Corporation Tax from 28 to 20 per cent over the course of the Parliament,",402,51620,201505
reduced National Insurance bills,402,51620,201505
and capped the rise in business rates.,402,51620,201505
"We have extended 100 per cent Small Business Rate Relief and are providing extra support for high street shops by increasing the business rates retail discount to £1,500.",402,51620,201505
"In the next Parliament, we want to maintain the most competitive business tax regime in the G20, and oppose Labour’s plans to increase Corporation Tax.",402,51620,201505
"We will conduct a major review into business rates by the end of 2015 to ensure that from 2017 they properly reflect the structure of our modern economy and provide clearer billing, better information sharing and a more efficient appeal system.",402,51620,201505
We will also repeal nonsensical restrictions banning employers from hiring agency staff to provide essential cover during strikes;,702,51620,201505
and ensure strikes cannot be called on the basis of ballots conducted years before.,702,51620,201505
We will tackle intimidation of non-striking workers;,702,51620,201505
legislate to ensure trade unions use a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions;,702,51620,201505
tighten the rules around taxpayer-funded paid ‘facility time’ for union representatives;,702,51620,201505
and reform the role of the Certification Officer.,702,51620,201505
"Strikes should only ever be the result of a clear, positive decision based on a ballot in which at least half the workforce has voted.",702,51620,201505
"This turnout threshold will be an important and fair step to rebalance the interests of employers, employees, the public and the rights of trade unions.",702,51620,201505
"We will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport.",702,51620,201505
Industrial action in these essential services would require the support of at least 40 per cent of all those entitled to take part in strike ballots,702,51620,201505
– as well as a majority of those who actually turn out to vote.,702,51620,201505
This Government was the first in post-war history to reduce the burden of regulation.,402,51620,201505
We will cut a further £10 billion of red tape over the next Parliament through our Red Tape Challenge and our One-In-Two-Out rule.,402,51620,201505
"This will support our aim to make Britain the best place in Europe, and one of the top five worldwide, to do business by 2020.",402,51620,201505
"We will also treble our successful Start Up Loans programme during the next Parliament so that 75,000 entrepreneurs get the chance to borrow money to set up their own business.",402,51620,201505
"We will raise the target for SMEs’ share of central government procurement to one-third,",402,51620,201505

"We have already helped small businesses by increasing the Annual Investment Allowance,",402,51620,201505

"We will go further by establishing a new Small Business Conciliation service to mediate in disputes, especially over late payment.",402,51620,201505
The creation of the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) in 2010 has resulted in many improvements to the UK tax system.,402,51620,201505
We will establish the OTS on a permanent basis and expand its role and capacity.,402,51620,201505
"We will boost our support for first-time exporters and back the GREAT campaign, so we achieve our goal of having 100,000 more UK companies exporting in 2020 than in 2010 and reach our target of £1 trillion in exports.",402,51620,201505
"And we will set a new, significantly higher, permanent level for the Annual Investment Allowance.",402,51620,201505
"Last year alone, 140,000 disabled people found work.",503,51620,201505
"But the jobless rate for this group remains too high and, as part of our objective to achieve full employment, we will aim to halve the disability employment gap:",503,51620,201505
"we will transform policy, practice and public attitudes, so that hundreds of thousands more disabled people who can and want to be in work find employment.",503,51620,201505
"We now have more women-led businesses than ever before,",503,51620,201505
more women in work than ever before,503,51620,201505
and more women on FTSE 100 boards than ever before.,503,51620,201505
"We want to see full, genuine gender equality.",503,51620,201505
"The gender pay gap is the lowest on record, but we want to reduce it further and will push business to do so:",503,51620,201505
we will require companies with more than 250 employees to publish the difference between the average pay of their male and female employees.,503,51620,201505
"Under Labour, women accounted for only one in eight FTSE 100 board members.",503,51620,201505
They represent a quarter of board members today and we want to see this rise further in the next Parliament.,503,51620,201505
"We also want to increase the proportion of public appointments going to women in the next Parliament,",503,51620,201505
as well as the number of female MPs.,503,51620,201505
"Now that the economy is growing strongly again, we have seen the first real-terms increase in the National Minimum Wage since Labour’s Great Recession began.",412,51620,201505
We strongly support the National Minimum Wage and want to see further real-terms increases in the next Parliament.,412,51620,201505
"We accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission that the National Minimum Wage should rise to £6.70 this autumn,",412,51620,201505
on course for a Minimum Wage that will be over £8 by the end of the decade.,412,51620,201505
We also support the Living Wage and will continue to encourage businesses and other organisations to pay it whenever they can afford it.,701,51620,201505
"We will also take further steps to eradicate abuses of workers, such as non-payment of the Minimum Wage,",701,51620,201505
exclusivity in zero-hours contracts,701,51620,201505
and exploitation of migrant workers.,701,51620,201505
"Great science is worthwhile in its own right and yields enormous practical benefits too – curing diseases, driving technological innovation, promoting business investment and informing public policy for the better.",411,51620,201505
We ring-fenced the science budget by making difficult choices to reduce spending in other areas.,411,51620,201505
Now we will invest new capital on a record scale – £6.9 billion in the UK’s research infrastructure up to 2021,411,51620,201505
"– which will mean new equipment, new laboratories and new research institutes.",411,51620,201505
"This long-term commitment includes £2.9 billion for a Grand Challenges Fund, which will allow us to invest in major research facilities of national significance, such as the new Alan Turing Institute, and projects such as the Polar Research Ship and Square Kilometre Array.",411,51620,201505
We have boosted research and development tax credits,411,51620,201505
"and we will continue to support our network of University Enterprise Zones, ensuring that Britain's world-beating universities are able to make money from the technology they develop.",411,51620,201505
"We will support our modern industrial strategies, such as our successful Life Sciences strategy, to help people compete and win in the intense global race for high value, high knowledge jobs.",411,51620,201505
We will work with the Automotive Council in support of our resurgent car industry,410,51620,201505
and direct further resources towards the Eight Great Technologies – among them robotics and nanotechnology – where Britain is set to be a global leader.,411,51620,201505
We have delivered a network of catapult centres – R&D hubs in the technologies of the future,411,51620,201505
– and we will create more to ensure that we have a bold and comprehensive offer in place for Britain’s researchers and innovators.,411,51620,201505
"We have the land, the technology, and the entrepreneurial flair to enable us to make the most of the economic potential of our rural areas.",410,51620,201505
We will provide rural Britain with near universal superfast broadband by the end of the next Parliament,411,51620,201505
"and secure the future of 3,000 rural Post Offices.",411,51620,201505
"We know how important it is to preserve vital community assets such as pubs, town halls and sports facilities, so we will strengthen the Community Right to Bid that we created.",606,51620,201505
"We will extend the length of time communities have to purchase these assets,",606,51620,201505
and require owners to set a clear ‘reserve’ price for the community to aim for when bidding.,606,51620,201505
"We will set up a Pub Loan Fund to enable community groups to obtain small loans to pay for feasibility work, lawyers’ fees, or materials for refurbishment, where they have bid to run the pub as part of our reforms to the Community Asset Register.",606,51620,201505

and implement our 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB.,703,51620,201505
"We will liberate farmers from red tape by coordinating all visits through a single Farm Inspection Taskforce, which will involve farmers themselves and use data from existing industry schemes, such as Red Tractor.",703,51620,201505
We will push for further reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.,703,51620,201505
We will promote British food abroad by setting up a Great British Food Unit to help trademark and promote local foods around the world,703,51620,201505
"and back British food at home, by guaranteeing that all central government departments purchase food to British standards of production by the end of the Parliament.",703,51620,201505
"We will also help consumers to buy British by pushing for country of origin labelling in Europe, particularly for dairy products, following on from our success with beef, lamb, pork and poultry.",703,51620,201505
"And we will champion our new Groceries Code Adjudicator, so farmers receive a fair deal from the supermarkets.",703,51620,201505
"We will defend our hard-won Common Fisheries Policy reforms, which include ending the scandalous practice of discarding perfectly edible fish",703,51620,201505
"and reforming the quota system so that all at-risk species, including cod, plaice, haddock and seabass, will be fished sustainably by the end of the next Parliament.",703,51620,201505
"We will continue to devolve the management of North Sea fisheries to local communities,",703,51620,201505
"and rebalance the UK’s inland water quotas to smaller, specific locally-based fishing communities.",703,51620,201505
"We will protect hunting, shooting and fishing, for all the benefits to individuals,",502,51620,201505
the environment,501,51620,201505
and the rural economy that these activities bring.,703,51620,201505
"A Conservative Government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.",305,51620,201505
"Our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but gives everyone – no matter their background – the chance to fulfil their potential.",503,51620,201505
Achieving this means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare.,404,51620,201505
"cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether",404,51620,201505
pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income Tax on what they earn,404,51620,201505
"back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold – so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays it",404,51620,201505
"cap overall welfare spending,",505,51620,201505
"lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive to £23,000",505,51620,201505
"and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay",505,51620,201505
"bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work,",504,51620,201505
and give working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.,504,51620,201505
"Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and more of their earnings taken away in tax to support a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged, people to choose benefits when they could be earning a living.",505,51620,201505
"This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right thing, you were penalised – and if you did the wrong thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all infuriating hardworking people.",505,51620,201505
"Over the last five years, we have cut people’s taxes wherever possible.",404,51620,201505
"We have raised the tax-free Personal Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475:",404,51620,201505
over 26 million people are now keeping more of their hard-earned money,404,51620,201505
and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no Income Tax at all.,404,51620,201505
"We believe that cutting people’s taxes is the right thing to do – not only because it is your money,",404,51620,201505
but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.,404,51620,201505
"Real fairness means that where people really cannot work, they must be supported – but where they are able to work, they should.",404,51620,201505
We have made long overdue changes to our welfare system.,505,51620,201505
We have capped benefits so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by going out to work.,505,51620,201505
We have begun to introduce Universal Credit – a way to simplify benefits into a new single payment – so that work always pays.,505,51620,201505
We are reassessing those on incapacity benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.,505,51620,201505
The days of something for nothing are over,505,51620,201505
"– and all this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of people living in workless households.",404,51620,201505
"In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard work:",404,51620,201505
raising the tax-free Personal Allowance so that those working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pay no Income Tax at all,404,51620,201505
and taking hardworking people out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to capture only the wealthy.,404,51620,201505
"And we will see through our welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out Universal Credit, to make the system fairer and reward hard work.",404,51620,201505
"A Conservative Government will not increase the rates of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next Parliament.",404,51620,201505
"Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance – the amount you can earn before you start paying tax – to £12,500.",503,51620,201505
"This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether.",503,51620,201505
"That means by the end of the decade, one million more people on the lowest wages will be lifted out of Income Tax,",503,51620,201505
and people who work for 30 hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage will no longer pay any Income Tax at all.,503,51620,201505
We will pass a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically rises in line with the National Minimum Wage.,503,51620,201505
The new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from the first Budget after the General Election.,503,51620,201505
"The change will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now increase more quickly.",503,51620,201505
The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the best-off people in our country.,503,51620,201505
"But in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into it.",503,51620,201505
We have already announced an above-inflation increase in the threshold next year.,404,51620,201505
"Now we will raise the 40p tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays the higher rate of Income Tax.",404,51620,201505
"The 800,000 people earning between £42,385 and £50,000 will no longer pay the 40p rate of tax.",404,51620,201505
"We will support you, whether you choose to go out to work or stay at home to raise your children.",603,51620,201505
"We will back the institution of marriage in our society, enabling married couples to transfer £1,060 of their tax-free income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner is a basic rate taxpayer.",603,51620,201505
"This applies to civil partnerships too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least in line with the Personal Allowance.",603,51620,201505
And we will help families stay together and handle the stresses of modern life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in relationship support.,603,51620,201505
"We have already legislated to introduce tax-free childcare in the next Parliament – worth up to £2,000 per child per year – to help parents who want to work.",504,51620,201505
We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four-year olds,504,51620,201505
and the most deprived two year-olds.,504,51620,201505
"And because working families with children under school age face particularly high childcare costs, in the next Parliament we will give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three and four year-olds.",504,51620,201505
"We will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending,",505,51620,201505
"enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who need it, and fair to those who pay for it too.",505,51620,201505
Our overall welfare cap will limit the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the five years from 2015-16.,505,51620,201505
"We will freeze working age benefits for two years from April 2016,",505,51620,201505
with exemptions for disability and pensioner benefits– as at present,503,51620,201505
"-as well as maternity allowance, statutory maternity pay, statutory paternity pay, statutory adoption pay and statutory sick pay.",505,51620,201505
"We will deliver Universal Credit, in order to provide the right incentives for people to work;",505,51620,201505
target support at those who need it most;,504,51620,201505

and streamline administration of the welfare system.,505,51620,201505
"We will work to eliminate child poverty and introduce better measures to drive real change in children’s lives, by recognising the root causes of poverty:  entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency.",503,51620,201505
"We will lower the maximum amount that a single household can claim in benefits each year from £26,000 to £23,000, so we reward work.",505,51620,201505
We will continue to have exemptions from the cap for those receiving Disability Living Allowance or the Personal Independence Payment.,503,51620,201505
We will make sure the hardest to help receive the support they need for a fulfilling life.,503,51620,201505
"We will review how best to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity, back into work.",504,51620,201505
People who might benefit from treatment should get the medical help they need so they can return to work,504,51620,201505
". If they refuse a recommended treatment, we will review whether their benefits should be reduced.",505,51620,201505
"We will also provide significant new support for mental health,",504,51620,201505
benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work benefits or being supported by Fit for Work.,504,51620,201505
"Our plan to control immigration will put you, your family and the British people first.",601,51620,201505
We will reduce the number of people coming to our country with tough new welfare conditions and robust enforcement.,601,51620,201505
"keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands",601,51620,201505

"Conservatives believe in controlled immigration, not mass immigration.",601,51620,201505
"Immigration brings real benefits to Britain – to our economy, our culture and our national life.",607,51620,201505
"We will always be a party that is open, outward-looking and welcoming to people from all around the world.",607,51620,201505
We also know that immigration must be controlled.,601,51620,201505
"When immigration is out of control, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals and transport;",601,51620,201505
and it can cause social pressures if communities find it hard to integrate.,608,51620,201505
"Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain had ever seen.",601,51620,201505
"Their open borders policy, combined with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for years over 90 percent of employment growth in this country was accounted for by foreign nationals",601,51620,201505
– even though there were 1.4 million people who spent most of the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits.,601,51620,201505
"For the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inherited.",601,51620,201505
"Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students;",605,51620,201505
installed proper exit checks at our borders;,605,51620,201505
cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages;,605,51620,201505
"made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, by restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences and private housing;",605,51620,201505
and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with spurious attempts to remain in the country.,605,51620,201505
All of this has made a difference.,605,51620,201505
Immigration from outside the EU has come down since 2010.,605,51620,201505
"We have seen many more people from the EU coming to Britain than originally anticipated, principally because our economy has been growing so much more rapidly and creating more jobs than other EU countries.",110,51620,201505
"As a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands.",110,51620,201505
That ambition remains the right one.,110,51620,201505
"But it is clearly going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to achieve.",110,51620,201505
,110,51620,201505
"We will negotiate new rules with the EU, so that people will have to be earning here for a number of years before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits that top up low wages.",110,51620,201505
"Instead of something-for-nothing, we will build a system based on the principle of something-for-something.",110,51620,201505
We will then put these changes to the British people in a straight in-out referendum on our membership of the European Union by the end of 2017.,110,51620,201505
"At the same time, we will continue to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave at the end of their visas.",605,51620,201505
"Across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes, we will build a system that truly puts you, your family and the British people first.",601,51620,201505
Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation.,110,51620,201505
"We have already banned housing benefit for EU jobseekers,",110,51620,201505
"and restricted other benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance.",110,51620,201505
We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years.,110,51620,201505
"This will reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-skilled workers to come to Britain.",110,51620,201505
"We will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years.",110,51620,201505
"If an EU migrant’s child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid.",110,51620,201505
"To reduce the numbers of EU migrants coming to Britain, we will end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all.",110,51620,201505
"And if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave.",110,51620,201505
"We will negotiate with the EU to introduce stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back,",110,51620,201505
and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement.,110,51620,201505
"We want to toughen requirements for non-EU spouses to join EU citizens, including with an income threshold and English language test.",110,51620,201505
"And when new countries are admitted to the EU in future, we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States.",110,51620,201505
We have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the EU.,406,51620,201505
"We will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament.",406,51620,201505
This will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy.,406,51620,201505
We will reform the student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once their visas expire.,406,51620,201505
"Our action will include clamping down on the number of so-called ‘satellite campuses’ opened in London by universities located elsewhere in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor system for student visas.",406,51620,201505
"And as the introduction of exit checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of their visa.",605,51620,201505
"We have introduced a ‘deport first, appeal later’ rule for foreign national offenders.",601,51620,201505
"We will now remove even more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart from asylum claims.",601,51620,201505
We will also implement a new removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious legal challenge and opportunities to abscond.,605,51620,201505
We will introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or deportation proceedings.,605,51620,201505
And we will implement the requirement for all landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants.,601,51620,201505
"We have already re-introduced a proper system of exit checks across the country,",605,51620,201505
"passed a Modern Slavery Act that will protect people from exploitation,",605,51620,201505
and quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who undercut the Minimum Wage.,605,51620,201505
Now we will introduce tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal working and exploitation.,605,51620,201505
"To crack down further on illegal working, we will harness data from multiple agencies, including Exit Checks data, to identify illegal immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers.",605,51620,201505
"And to incentivise tougher action on employers who do not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines levied on employers.",605,51620,201505
We are taking unprecedented action to tackle health tourism and will recover up to £500 million from migrants who use the NHS by the middle of the next Parliament.,601,51620,201505
"To help communities experiencing high and unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introduce a new Controlling Migration Fund to ease pressures on services and to pay for additional immigration enforcement.",601,51620,201505
"To prevent sectors becoming partially or wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those regularly utilising the Shortage Occupation List, under which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the UK, to provide long-term plans for training British workers.",601,51620,201505
We will promote integration and British values,608,51620,201505
Being able to speak English is a fundamental part of integrating into our society.,608,51620,201505
We have introduced tough new language tests for migrants and ensured councils reduce spending on translation services.,608,51620,201505
"Next, we will legislate to ensure that every public sector worker operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent English.",608,51620,201505
"And to encourage better integration into our society, we will also require those coming to Britain on a family visa with only basic English to become more fluent over time, with new language tests for those seeking a visa extension.",608,51620,201505
Your child deserves the best start in life.,503,51620,201505
A good education is not a luxury; it should be a right for everyone.,506,51620,201505
"We will: ensure a good primary school place for your child, with zero tolerance for failure",506,51620,201505
turn every failing and coasting secondary school into an academy and deliver free schools for parents and communities that want them,506,51620,201505
"help teachers to make Britain the best country in the world for developing maths, engineering, science and computing skills",601,51620,201505
create 3 million new apprenticeships,411,51620,201505
"and make sure there is no cap on university places, so we have aspiration for all.",506,51620,201505
We know what works in education: great teachers; brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline in the classroom; proper exams.,506,51620,201505
"We have been bold in reforming the education system to deliver these things, based upon simple, clear principles and values.",506,51620,201505
We believe that parents and teachers should be empowered to run their schools independently.,506,51620,201505
"We believe that teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need to attract the best graduates into it.",506,51620,201505
And we believe that there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum to secure the best from every pupil.,506,51620,201505
We inherited a system where far too many children left school without the qualifications and skills they needed.,506,51620,201505
"One in three children was leaving primary school unable to read, write and add up properly.",506,51620,201505
The number of pupils studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.,506,51620,201505
Our schools had fallen down the global league tables for maths and science.,506,51620,201505
And the poorest children were attending the weakest schools.,506,51620,201505
Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this.,506,51620,201505
"We have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the curriculum.",506,51620,201505
"Today, there are a million more pupils in schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’.",506,51620,201505
"Over a thousand schools that were ranked ‘inadequate’ have become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote discipline, rigour and higher standards.",506,51620,201505
,506,51620,201505
There are over 250 new free schools – set up and run by local people – delivering better education for the children who need it most.,506,51620,201505
We have boosted the number of apprenticeships to record levels – 2.2 million over the last five years,411,51620,201505
– and last September more people headed off to university than at any time in history.,506,51620,201505
"Too many children, however, are still not receiving the excellent education that they deserve.",506,51620,201505
"So we will continue our reforms, so that every child has the best possible start in life.",506,51620,201505
We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade inflation.,506,51620,201505
There is more to do.,506,51620,201505
We will start by introducing tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary schools.,506,51620,201505
We will expect every 11-year-old to know their times tables off by heart and be able to perform long division and complex multiplication.,506,51620,201505
"They should be able to read a book and write a short story with accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar.",506,51620,201505
"If children do not reach the required standards in their exams at the end of primary school, they will resit them at the start of secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.",506,51620,201505
"We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and history or geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.",506,51620,201505
We have more than doubled Labour’s spending on new school places.,506,51620,201505
"But we want to go even further, investing at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide good school places.",506,51620,201505
"And we will let our best headteachers take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the National Leaders of Education programme.",506,51620,201505
"Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy status, giving them more power over discipline and budgets.",506,51620,201505
And nearly 800 of the worst-performing primary schools have been taken over by experienced academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.,506,51620,201505
This is improving education for our children.,506,51620,201505
"So we will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio schools and University Technical Colleges.",506,51620,201505
"Over the next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free schools,",506,51620,201505
"resulting in 270,000 new school places.",506,51620,201505
And we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools to accept new leadership.,506,51620,201505
Any school judged by Ofsted to be requiring improvement will be taken over by the best headteachers – backed by expert sponsors or high-performing neighbouring schools – unless it can demonstrate that it has a plan to improve rapidly.,506,51620,201505
"We will continue to allow all good schools to expand, whether they are maintained schools, academies, free schools or grammar schools.",506,51620,201505
"Over the last five years, we have protected the schools budget and committed £18 billion for new school buildings, so that children can learn in the best environment possible.",506,51620,201505
"Under a future Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into school will be protected.",506,51620,201505
"As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of money in our schools.",506,51620,201505
"On current pupil number forecasts, there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in the next Parliament.",506,51620,201505
"We will continue to provide the pupil premium, protected at current rates, so that schools receive additional money for those from the poorest backgrounds.",506,51620,201505
We will support families by providing free meals to all infants.,504,51620,201505
And we will make schools funding fairer.,506,51620,201505
"We have already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for their funding in the next Parliament.",506,51620,201505
We will not allow state schools to make a profit.,506,51620,201505
We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.,506,51620,201505
"In the next Parliament, we will expect every teacher to be trained not just in how to tackle serious behaviour issues, but also in how to deal with the low level disruption that stops children from learning properly.",506,51620,201505
This generation of teachers is already the best-qualified ever.,506,51620,201505
"In future, we will recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they spend on paperwork,",506,51620,201505
"introducing bursaries for the most in-demand subjects,",506,51620,201505
"paying good teachers more,",506,51620,201505
further reducing the burden of Ofsted inspections,506,51620,201505
and continuing to encourage the growth of Teach First.,506,51620,201505
"We will increase the number of teachers able to teach Mandarin in schools in England, so we can compete in the global race.",506,51620,201505
"We want teachers to be regarded in the same way as other highly skilled professionals, so we are supporting the creation of an independent College of Teaching to promote the highest standards of teaching and school leadership.",506,51620,201505
"We have increased the time schools will spend on maths, and ensured that children learn to code as soon as they start school.",506,51620,201505
Maths is now the most popular A-level subject.,506,51620,201505
"We aim to make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and engineering, measured by improved performance in the PISA league tables.",601,51620,201505
"To help achieve this, we will train an extra 17,500 maths and physics teachers over the next five years.",506,51620,201505
We will make sure that all students are pushed to achieve their potential and create more opportunities to stretch the most able.,506,51620,201505
"Every child deserves a warm, loving home, and to feel safe online and at school.",503,51620,201505
We have made improving support for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities a priority.,503,51620,201505
"We have created 2,200 more special schools places through our free schools programme,",506,51620,201505

"We will introduce regional adoption agencies, working across local authority boundaries to match children with the best parents for them.",504,51620,201505
"We will continue to raise the quality of children’s social work, by expanding training programmes, such as Frontline, and creating new opportunities to develop the next generation of leaders in the field.",504,51620,201505
We will continue to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.,504,51620,201505
"And we will stop children's exposure to harmful sexualised content online, by requiring age verification for access to all sites containing pornographic material and age-rating for all music videos.",504,51620,201505
"We have given employers much more control over apprenticeship courses, so they teach skills relevant to the workplace.",411,51620,201505
"We will continue to replace lower-level, classroom-based Further Education courses with high-quality apprenticeships that combine training with experience of work and a wage.",411,51620,201505

"This year, for the first time, over half a million people have been admitted to our universities, including a record proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.",506,51620,201505
"From September, we will go even further, abolishing the cap on higher education student numbers and removing an arbitrary ceiling on ambition.",506,51620,201505
"Our reforms to university funding mean you do not have to pay anything towards tuition while studying, and only start paying back if you earn over £21,000 per year.",506,51620,201505
"We will ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms, so that the interests of both students and taxpayers are fairly represented.",404,51620,201505

We will maintain our universities’ reputation for world-class research and academic excellence.,601,51620,201505

"put more of the essential services you use online, to make them more convenient",303,51620,201505
"continue to make government more transparent, so you can hold us to account for how your money is being spent.",202,51620,201505
"Government is the servant of the British people, not their master.",202,51620,201505
That simple fact was forgotten when Labour was in power.,202,51620,201505
"Quangos grew in number, wasteful projects proliferated and the bureaucracy swelled – symptoms of a Government that believed it always knew best.",303,51620,201505
Conservatives have brought in a new approach.,303,51620,201505
"We are determined to measure success not by how much money is spent, but how much it improves people’s lives.",303,51620,201505
Whitehall is now leaner and smaller than at any time since the Second World War.,303,51620,201505
We have halved the running costs of the Department for Education.,303,51620,201505
We have abolished or merged over 300 quangos.,303,51620,201505

"We have shone a bright light on government spending – requiring all central government spending over £25,000 to be published online.",303,51620,201505
We have also ensured that people recieve a transparent breakdown of how their taxes are spent.,303,51620,201505
"In the next five years, we will ensure this efficiency revolution continues.",303,51620,201505
We will also continue to reform our political system:,303,51620,201505
"make votes of more equal value through long overdue boundary reforms,",303,51620,201505
reducing the number of MPs,303,51620,201505
and ensuring the Electoral Commission does more to tackle voting fraud.,304,51620,201505
These measures will help to restore public confidence in British politics.,304,51620,201505
"We have reduced the cost of government, by selling empty buildings, managing big projects better, managing big projects better, shrinking the Civil Service, reforming pensions, moving more services online, and improving contracting.",303,51620,201505
We plan a further £10 billion annual savings by 2017-18,303,51620,201505
and £1520 billion in 2019-20.,303,51620,201505
"To eliminate the deficit, we must continue to cut out wasteful spending",414,51620,201505
We have supported the growth of public service mutuals – organisations that are owned by their staff and deliver public services.,303,51620,201505
"We want more of them, so we will guarantee a ‘right to mutualise’ within the public sector.",303,51620,201505
This will free up the entrepreneurial spirit of public servants and yield better value for money for taxpayers.,303,51620,201505
Transparency has also been at the heart of our approach to government.,202,51620,201505
"Over the last five years, we have been open about government spending, provided access to taxpayer-funded research, pursued open data and helped establish the Open Government Partnership.",303,51620,201505
We will continue to be the most transparent government in the world.,202,51620,201505
"We addressed public concern about the influence of money on politics, with a law that strengthened rules governing non-party campaigning and established a register of consultant lobbyists.",303,51620,201505
"In the next Parliament, we will legislate to ensure trade unions use a transparent opt-in process for subscriptions to political parties.",702,51620,201505
We will continue to seek agreement on a comprehensive package of party funding reform.,303,51620,201505
We value our outstanding public servants.,303,51620,201505
"Over the last five years, we have made efficiencies in government.",303,51620,201505

"Britain's impartial, professional and highly capable Civil Service is admired around the world and one of our nation's strengths.",601,51620,201505

"We will make recruitment to the Civil Service more open and actively look for exceptional talent, especially in areas where capabilities are in short supply.",303,51620,201505
We will continue to tackle all the bureaucracy of Whitehall that clogs the arteries of government.,303,51620,201505
We will end taxpayer-funded six-figure payoffs for the best paid public sector workers.,303,51620,201505
We will continue to sell unneeded government property and co-locate services wherever possible.,303,51620,201505
"We have already created 20 high-quality digital services, which include apprenticeships applications and tax self-assessments.",303,51620,201505
"We will save you time, hassle and money by moving more services online,",303,51620,201505
while actively tackling digital exclusion.,303,51620,201505
"We will ensure digital assistance is always available for those who are not online,",303,51620,201505
while rolling out cross-government technology platforms to cut costs and improve productivity – such as GOV.UK.,303,51620,201505
"We have improved the operation of Parliament,",303,51620,201505
"strengthening its ability to hold the Government to account, with reforms such as the election of Select Committee chairs and the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, which enables backbenchers, for the first time, to determine a significant proportion of the House of Commons’ business.",303,51620,201505
"We have also passed the Fixed Term Parliament Act, an unprecedented transfer of Executive power.",202,51620,201505
"In the next Parliament, we will address the unfairness of the current Parliamentary boundaries,",202,51620,201505
reduce the number of MPs to 600 to cut the cost of politics,303,51620,201505
and make votes of more equal value.,202,51620,201505
We will implement the boundary reforms that Parliament has already approved and make them apply automatically once the Boundary Commission reports in 2018.,202,51620,201505
This will deal with the fact that the current electoral layout over-represents parts of the country where populations have been falling and under-represents parts where populations have been rising.,202,51620,201505
"While we still see a strong case for introducing an elected element into our second chamber, this is not a priority in the next Parliament.",203,51620,201505
We have already allowed for expulsion of members for poor conduct and will ensure the House of Lords continues to work well by addressing issues such as the size of the chamber and the retirement of peers.,203,51620,201505
"Building on our introduction of individual voter registration, we will continue to make our arrangements fair and effective by ensuring the Electoral Commission puts greater priority on tackling fraud and considers insisting on proof of ID to vote.",304,51620,201505
"We will complete the electoral register, by working to include more of the five million Britons who live abroad.",202,51620,201505
"We will introduce votes for life, scrapping the rule that bars British citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years from voting.",202,51620,201505
"We will respect the will of the British people, as expressed in the 2011 referendum, and keep First Past the Post for elections to the House of Commons.",203,51620,201505
"And we will introduce English votes for English laws, answering the longstanding West Lothian Question in our democracy.",204,51620,201505
The chance to own your own home should be available to everyone who works hard.,503,51620,201505
We will: help to keep mortgage rates lower by continuing to work through our long-term  economic plan,404,51620,201505
"build more homes that people can afford, including 200,000 new Starter Homes exclusively for first-time buyers under 40",403,51620,201505
"extend the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to 2020 to help more people onto and up the housing ladder,",403,51620,201505
and introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people saving for a deposit,403,51620,201505
give more people the chance to own their home by extending the Right to Buy to tenants of Housing Associations,403,51620,201505
and create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land,403,51620,201505
ensure local people have more control over planning and protect the Green Belt,403,51620,201505
Conservatives believe passionately in home ownership.,404,51620,201505
"We understand how good it feels when you have worked long hours, saved money for years, and finally take possession of the keys to your first home.",404,51620,201505
"For years, however, people have been finding it harder and harder to get on the housing ladder.",404,51620,201505
"Under Labour, house-building fell to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s.",404,51620,201505
Developers were building too few homes,404,51620,201505
and the aftermath of the banking crisis saw young people struggling to raise a deposit,404,51620,201505
These past five years have been about reversing this trend.,404,51620,201505
"We have unblocked the planning system, to help builders start building again.",402,51620,201505
"We have introduced Help to Buy, making it much easier for people to secure a mortgage.",403,51620,201505
"And we have reinvigorated the Right to Buy which Labour had cut back, extending home ownership to a whole new generation of social tenants.",403,51620,201505
"As a result, over 200,000 people have been helped either on or up the housing ladder.",403,51620,201505
Most of those helped have been young first-time buyers spread right across our country.,403,51620,201505
"As the party of home ownership, we want to go further and faster – and this manifesto sets out our plan.",404,51620,201505
"At its heart, a clear objective to build affordable homes,",404,51620,201505
"including 200,000 Starter Homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent discount, and will be built exclusively for first time buyers under the age of 40.",403,51620,201505
"At the same time, we will extend our Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme,",403,51620,201505
"introduce a new Help to Buy ISA,",403,51620,201505
extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants,403,51620,201505
"and make sure that, when it comes to planning decisions, local people are in charge.",403,51620,201505
"And for all those already in their home, we will make sure we continue working through our economic plan, so mortgage rates stay lower for longer and people can keep hold of their homes and plan for the future",404,51620,201505
– safe in the knowledge they have a government that is competently looking after the public finances so they can look after their own.,404,51620,201505
We are setting an ambition to double the number of first-time buyers compared to the last five years – helping one million more people to own their own home.,409,51620,201505
"We will extend Help to Buy to cover another 120,000 homes – in total helping over 200,000 people",409,51620,201505
"and we will continue the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee until the start of 2017,",409,51620,201505
and the Help to Buy equity loan until at least 2020.,409,51620,201505
"From this autumn, we will introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people who are working hard to save up for a deposit for their first home.",409,51620,201505
"A ten per cent deposit on the average first home costs £15,000, so if you put in up to £12,000, government will put in up to £3,000 more.",409,51620,201505
A 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving a deposit from your pre-tax income – making it effectively a tax cut for first-time buyers.,409,51620,201505
"We will build 200,000 quality Starter Homes over the course of the next Parliament, reserved for first-time buyers under 40 and sold at 20 per cent below the market price.",409,51620,201505
"We have delivered over 217,000 new affordable homes since 2010.",404,51620,201505
"We will now go further, delivering 275,000 additional affordable homes by 2020.",404,51620,201505
"And we will offer 10,000 new homes to rent at below market rates, to help people save for a deposit.",409,51620,201505
We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in Housing Associations to enable more people to buy a home of their own.,404,51620,201505
It is unfair that they should miss out on a right enjoyed by tenants in local authority homes.,503,51620,201505
"We will fund the replacement of properties sold under the extended Right to Buy by requiring local authorities to manage their housing assets more efficiently, with the most expensive properties sold off and replaced as they fall vacant.",404,51620,201505
We will also create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land for additional housing.,404,51620,201505
"We aim at least to double the number of custom-built and self-built homes by 2020, and we will take forward a new Right to Build, requiring councils to allocate land to local people to build or commission their own home, as you can do in most of Europe.",410,51620,201505
We have safeguarded national Green Belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces.,501,51620,201505
We have abolished the Labour Government’s top-down Regional Strategies which sought to delete the Green Belt in and around 30 towns and cities and introduced a new Local Green Space planning designation which allows councils and neighbourhood plans to give added protection to valuable local green spaces.,416,51620,201505
"We will support locally-led garden cities and towns in places where communities want them, such as Ebbsfleet and Bicester.",416,51620,201505
"When new homes are granted planning permission, we will make sure local communities know up-front that necessary infrastructure such as schools and roads will be provided.",411,51620,201505
We will ensure that brownfield land is used as much as possible for new development.,416,51620,201505
"We will require local authorities to have a register of what is available, and ensure that 90 per cent of suitable brownfield sites have planning permission for housing by 2020.",416,51620,201505
"To meet the capital’s housing needs, we will create a new London Land Commission, with a mandate to identify and release all surplus brownfield land owned by the public sector.",416,51620,201505
"We will fund Housing Zones to transform brownfield sites into new housing, which will create 95,000 new homes.",416,51620,201505
"Under this Government, average council tax bills in England have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per cent.",404,51620,201505
"Whereas Labour wants to propose a new tax on family homes, we will help local authorities keep council tax low for hardworking taxpayers,",404,51620,201505
and ensure residents can continue to veto high rises via a local referendum.,301,51620,201505
"And in London, where there is a Conservative Mayor, bills have fallen even further.",404,51620,201505
"We will continue to work with councillors to deliver high quality, value for money services.",404,51620,201505
"We will encourage voluntary integration of services and administration between and within councils – for example, with the Troubled Families Programme and the Better Care Fund – to promote savings and improve local services.",301,51620,201505
"We want local councils to help manage public land and buildings, and will give them at least a 10 per cent stake in public sector land sales in their area.",301,51620,201505
We want local authorities to help create strong local economies.,301,51620,201505
"Building on the local retention of business rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the business rates revenue that is generated in their area.",301,51620,201505
This will provide a strong financial incentive for councils to promote economic growth.,301,51620,201505
We will review how we can further reduce ring-fencing and remove Whitehall burdens to give councils more flexibility to support local services.,301,51620,201505
"We will support Business Improvement Districts and other forms of business-led collaboration on high streets – giving more say to local traders on issues such as minor planning applications, cleaning and parking.",301,51620,201505
"We will continue to support local shops and residents in tackling aggressive parking enforcement and excessive parking charges, and take steps to tackle rogue and unfair practices by private parking operators.",301,51620,201505
"Our Coastal Communities Fund will help our seaside areas thrive, helping to boost skills and create jobs.",301,51620,201505
We set ourselves the goal of being the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than that in which we found it.,501,51620,201505
This is a big ambition to which we remain committed. We will:,501,51620,201505
put in place a new ‘Blue Belt’ to protect precious marine habitats,501,51620,201505
invest in cleaner air and water for you and your family,501,51620,201505
keep our forests in trust for the nation,501,51620,201505
"For Conservatives, Britain’s ‘green and pleasant land’ is not some relic from a bygone era, to be mourned and missed: it’s the living, breathing backdrop to our national life.",601,51620,201505
"Our moors and meadows, wildlife and nature, air and water are a crucial part of our national identity and make our country what it is.",601,51620,201505
"So we care about them deeply, want to protect them for everyone and pass them onto future generations.",601,51620,201505
Labour never understood this.,601,51620,201505
Our rural communities fell further behind urban areas;,503,51620,201505
"biodiversity suffered, with important species and habitats declining under their watch;",501,51620,201505
and they failed to protect the Green Belt.,501,51620,201505
"Over the last five years, we have committed billions of pounds to reduce emissions from transport and clean up our rivers and seas.",501,51620,201505
"We have done more to protect our seas, safeguarded our Green Belt and planted 11 million trees.",501,51620,201505
"And we set out a comprehensive, long-term vision to protect our natural heritage in this country’s first White Paper on the Natural Environment for 20 years.",501,51620,201505
"Over the next five years, we will put in place stronger protections for our natural landscapes,",501,51620,201505
"establish a new Blue Belt to safeguard precious marine habitats,",501,51620,201505
launch a programme of pocket parks in towns and cities,501,51620,201505
and continue to lead in tackling the illegal wildlife trade.,501,51620,201505
Our plan is to conserve and enhance our natural environment so that this remains the most beautiful country in the world.,601,51620,201505
"We will spend £3 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy to enhance England’s countryside over the next five years,",501,51620,201505
"enabling us, among other things, to clean up our rivers and lakes,",501,51620,201505
"protect our stonewalls and hedges,",501,51620,201505
and help our bees to thrive.,501,51620,201505

"We will make it easier to access our beautiful landscapes, by providing free, comprehensive maps of all open-access green space.",501,51620,201505
"Building on our introduction of a five pence charge on single-use plastic bags, we will review the case for higher Fixed Penalty Notices for littering and allow councils to tackle small-scale fly-tipping through Fixed Penalties rather than costly prosecutions.",501,51620,201505
We will launch an ambitious programme of pocket parks – small areas of inviting public space where people can enjoy relief from the hustle and bustle of city streets.,501,51620,201505
"We will protect the Green Belt,",501,51620,201505
"and maintain national protections for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty,",501,51620,201505
"National Parks,",501,51620,201505
Sites of Special Scientific Interest,501,51620,201505

"We will continue to do even more to tackle air pollution and clean up our rivers and waterways, including supporting the Thames Tideway Tunnel.",501,51620,201505
"We have spent over £3 billion on improving flood defences, and capped the cost of flood insurance.",501,51620,201505
"We will now go further, building 1,400 new flood defence schemes, to protect 300,000 homes.",501,51620,201505
"We will build new roads and railways in a way that limits, as far as possible, their impact on the environment.",501,51620,201505
"This includes investing £300 million in cutting light pollution from new roads,",501,51620,201505
"doing more tunnelling,",501,51620,201505
building better noise barriers,501,51620,201505
and helping to restore lost habitat.,501,51620,201505
We will also replace locally any biodiversity lost in the construction of High Speed 2.,501,51620,201505
"We set up the Natural Capital Committee to put hard economic numbers on the value of our environment, and we will extend its life to at least the end of the next Parliament.",501,51620,201505
"We will work with it to develop a 25 Year Plan to restore the UK’s biodiversity,",501,51620,201505
and to ensure that both public and private investment in the environment is directed where we need it most.,501,51620,201505
"Earlier this year, we announced the creation of a new Marine Protected Area around the Pitcairn Islands – the largest protected expanse of sea in the world.",501,51620,201505
"We will now go even further, creating a Blue Belt around the UK’s 14 Overseas Territories, subject to local support and environmental need.",501,51620,201505
"We will designate a further protected area at Ascension Island, subject to the views of the local community.",501,51620,201505
"And, off our own coasts, we will complete the network of Marine Conservation Zones that we have already started, to create a UK Blue Belt of protected sites.",501,51620,201505
"The quality of the food on your plate, and the economic security of our farmers, depend on us upholding the highest standards of animal welfare.",501,51620,201505
We will push for high animal welfare standards to be incorporated into international trade agreements and into reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.,501,51620,201505
We will ban wild animals in circuses,501,51620,201505
and press for all EU member states to ensure that animals are only sent to slaughterhouses that meet high welfare standards.,501,51620,201505
We will encourage other countries to follow the EU’s lead in banning animal testing for cosmetics,501,51620,201505
and work to accelerate the global development and take-up of alternatives to animal testing where appropriate.,501,51620,201505
"We want people to integrate fully into British society, but that does not mean they should have to give up the things they hold dear in their religion.",603,51620,201505
"So while we will always make sure the Food Standards Agency properly regulates the slaughter of livestock and poultry, we will protect methods of religious slaughter, such as shechita and halal.",603,51620,201505
"As hosts of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade, we helped secure the adoption of the London Declaration on Illegal Wildlife Trade and will continue to lead the world in stopping the poaching that kills thousands of rhinos, elephants and tigers each year.",501,51620,201505

"meet our climate change commitments, cutting carbon emissions as cheaply as possible, to save you money",403,51620,201505
"Without secure energy supplies, we leave British families and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and gas prices;",403,51620,201505
we increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy; and we become less safe and less prosperous as a result.,403,51620,201505
National energy policy demands a willingness to take decisions today for the good of tomorrow.,403,51620,201505
But Labour took the opposite approach.,403,51620,201505
Power margins – the safety cushion we need to prevent blackouts – have fallen to record lows because of their historic failure to invest in new capacity.,403,51620,201505
Domestic sources of oil and gas were unexploited.,403,51620,201505
"And Labour failed to deliver the next generation of energy projects that will help us keep the lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissions.",403,51620,201505
All this hurt consumers.,403,51620,201505
"The number of major energy suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the average gas bill more than doubling.",403,51620,201505
We have taken a different approach.,403,51620,201505
"Where Labour was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent, affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years, but for the coming decades.",404,51620,201505
Our long-term plan has unlocked £59 billion of investment in electricity.,404,51620,201505

"and the birth of a new industry, shale gas,",410,51620,201505
which could create many thousands of jobs.,701,51620,201505
And we have delivered a better deal for consumers too.,403,51620,201505
We have demanded that energy companies simplify their tariffs;,403,51620,201505
encouraged more independent suppliers – which now account for ten per cent of the household market;,403,51620,201505
and made it much easier for people to switch energy providers.,403,51620,201505
But the job is only half done.,403,51620,201505
We need a Conservative Government to see through this long-term plan and secure clean but affordable energy supplies for generations to come.,404,51620,201505
This means a significant expansion in new nuclear and gas;,410,51620,201505
backing good-value green energy;,501,51620,201505
and pushing for more new investment in UK energy sources.,410,51620,201505
"Healthy competition, not short-termist political intervention, is the best way to secure a good deal for consumers.",403,51620,201505
So we will keep on relentlessly pushing for more competition to keep bills low.,403,51620,201505
This is a long-term plan to keep the lights on;,404,51620,201505
keep our homes warm;,404,51620,201505

"made it easier for customers to switch to better deals,",403,51620,201505
"slashed the number of tariffs to just 4 per supplier,",403,51620,201505

but will only give significant support to those that clearly represent value for money.,402,51620,201505
Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary increase in renewable capacity.,416,51620,201505
"Onshore windfarms often fail to win public support, however, and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires.",416,51620,201505
"As a result, we will end any new public subsidy for them and change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications.",416,51620,201505
"We have been the greenest government ever, setting up the world’s first Green Investment Bank,",501,51620,201505

"But the scale of the threat to our country from a number of terrorist groups remains serious,",601,51620,201505
"and the rise of ISIL in Syria and Iraq has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks against Britain can be planned, financed and directed.",601,51620,201505
"However, the nature of the threat we face is making it more difficult for the security services to identify terrorist plots – especially thanks to new technology.",605,51620,201505

"We have abolished the 55 per cent tax on pension pots, so that when the deceased is 75 or over any beneficiary only has to pay their marginal Income Tax rate – normally 20 per cent – when they draw down the pension.",504,51620,201505
"And we have enabled anyone who dies before the age of 75 to pass on their pension pot completely tax-free, so that beneficiaries will pay no tax on pensions they inherit or on the income they draw down.",504,51620,201505
"And we will take the family home out of tax for all but the richest by increasing the effective Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million,",503,51620,201505
"with a new transferable main residence allowance of £175,000 per person.",503,51620,201505
"This will be paid for by reducing the tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000.",503,51620,201505
"Wherever you live in the great nations of our United Kingdom, we are on your side.",601,51620,201505
"We will: give English MPs a veto over matters only affecting England, including on Income Tax",204,51620,201505
honour in full our commitments to Scotland to devolve extensive new powers,301,51620,201505
"implement the agreed settlement for Wales, handing over more responsibility to the Welsh Assembly",301,51620,201505
"continue to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is strong.",301,51620,201505
"England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – ours is the greatest union of nations the world has ever seen.",601,51620,201505
"Together we have done so much, and we can do much more.",601,51620,201505
The Conservative Party is the party of the Union – and we will always do our utmost to keep our family of nations together.,601,51620,201505
"It was right to create the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, but the job was not finished.",301,51620,201505
"Without the ability to raise money, the devolved Parliaments were not accountable to taxpayers.",301,51620,201505
"Without devolution to local councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever.",301,51620,201505
"And one fundamental unfairness remains today: Scottish MPs are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that only affected England and Wales, while English and Welsh MPs cannot vote on matters that only affect Scotland.",204,51620,201505
This leaves a space for resentment to fester – and put our Union in jeopardy.,204,51620,201505
We have tackled the problems we inherited.,301,51620,201505
"First, we held the referendum on Scottish independence.",301,51620,201505
"It was the right thing to do, and the question of Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom is now settled.",301,51620,201505
We have made the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly responsible for funding more of what they spend.,301,51620,201505
"We have agreed with Northern Ireland’s parties a deal to help ensure that politics works, the economy grows and society is more cohesive and united.",301,51620,201505
And we have set out clear plans for English votes for English laws.,301,51620,201505
All this reflects a core Conservative belief: power to the people.,301,51620,201505
Around Britain you can see that principle in practice.,601,51620,201505
"In town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public spending.",301,51620,201505
"In communities, local people have the right to vote in referendums on council tax rises.",301,51620,201505
Neighbourhoods are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to assets such as parks and public buildings.,301,51620,201505
Our commitment to the Union means we want to strengthen it.,301,51620,201505
We will let local people have more say on local planning and let them vote on local issues.,301,51620,201505
"We will not let anyone impose artificial regions on England – our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are here to stay.",301,51620,201505
"We will continue devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales, and implement the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland.",301,51620,201505
"And we will give English MPs a veto over English-only matters, including on Income Tax – answering the West Lothian Question.",204,51620,201505
"In the last five years, we have proven that we are the party of the Union.",301,51620,201505
"We will go further in the next Parliament, pushing power out beyond Westminster, Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, so we keep our United Kingdom strong and secure for the long term.",301,51620,201505
"We will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.",203,51620,201505
We will strengthen and improve devolution for each part of our United Kingdom in a way that accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution:,301,51620,201505
"we will implement the Smith Commission and St David’s Day Agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the UK, including English votes for English laws.",301,51620,201505
We will maintain the Westminster Parliament as the UK and England’s law-making body.,203,51620,201505
"But we want Parliament to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting England, or England and Wales, can only be taken with the consent of the majority of MPs representing constituencies in England, or in England and Wales.",204,51620,201505
"We will end the manifest unfairness whereby Scotland is able to decide its own laws in devolved areas, only for Scottish MPs also to be able to have the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only England and Wales.",204,51620,201505
"We will maintain the integrity of the UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set overall spending levels.",301,51620,201505
But we will: change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of legislation affecting only England or England and Wales will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion to party strength in England or England and Wales.,204,51620,201505
"add a new stage to how English legislation is passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to England would be able to pass to its Third Reading and become law without being approved through a legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee made up of all English MPs, or all English and Welsh MPs.",204,51620,201505
extend the principle of English consent to financial matters such as how spending is distributed within England and to taxation – including an English rate of Income Tax – when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland.,301,51620,201505
A new Scotland Bill will be in our first Queen’s Speech and will be introduced in the first session of a new Parliament.,301,51620,201505
We will implement the recommendations of the Smith Commission so that more than 50 per cent of the Scottish Parliament’s budget will be funded from revenues raised in Scotland,301,51620,201505
and it will have significant new welfare powers to complement existing devolved powers in health and social care.,301,51620,201505
We will provide the Scottish Parliament with one of the most extensive packages of tax and spending powers of any devolved legislature in the world.,301,51620,201505
We will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for determining the grant to cover that part of the Scottish Parliament’s budget not funded by tax revenues raised in Scotland.,301,51620,201505
"We will agree new rules with the Scottish Government for how the block grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved tax and welfare powers.",301,51620,201505
"And we will ensure that where responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes only affect public spending in that part of the country.",301,51620,201505
We will clarify the division of powers between Wales and the UK Government.,301,51620,201505
"We will: devolve to the Welsh Assembly control over its own affairs– including the Assembly name, size and electoral system, Assembly elections and voting age.",301,51620,201505
implement other recommendations of the second Silk Report where there is all-party support as set out in the St David’s Day Agreement;,301,51620,201505
this will include devolving to the Welsh Assembly important economic powers over ports and energy consents.,301,51620,201505
introduce a new Wales Bill if these changes require legislation.,301,51620,201505
continue to reserve policing and justice as matters for the UK Parliament.,301,51620,201505
"introduce a ‘funding floor’ to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.",301,51620,201505
make the Welsh Government responsible for raising more of the money it spends so the Welsh people can hold their politicians to account.,301,51620,201505
We will maintain Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom on the basis of the consent of its people.,301,51620,201505
Our strong support for the political institutions established over the past two decades as a result of the various Agreements will continue.,301,51620,201505
"We will : develop and implement our strategy to combat terrorism,",605,51620,201505
giving the strongest possible support to the brave men and women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.,605,51620,201505
work to implement fully and faithfully the historic Stormont House Agreement to enable devolution to function more effectively;,301,51620,201505
to deal with the legacy of the past;,301,51620,201505
and to make progress on divisive issues such as flags and parading.,301,51620,201505
continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to implement commitments in the 2013 economic pact to rebalance the economy and to build a more united and stronger society.,301,51620,201505
"complete the devolution of Corporation Tax powers to the Assembly, consistent with the Executive fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform and efficiencies in the Stormont House Agreement.",301,51620,201505
"For too long, your voice has been ignored on Europe.",110,51620,201505
"We will: give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the EU, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017",110,51620,201505
commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the Eurozone,110,51620,201505
"reform the workings of the EU, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic",110,51620,201505
reclaim power from Brussels on your behalf and safeguard British interests in the Single Market,110,51620,201505
back businesses to create jobs in Britain by completing ambitious trade deals and,410,51620,201505
The EU needs to change.,110,51620,201505
And it is time for the British people – not politicians – to have their say.,110,51620,201505
"Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change and real choice on Europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.",110,51620,201505
Labour failed to give you a choice on the EU.,110,51620,201505
"They handed over major new powers to Brussels without your consent, and gave away £7 billion of the British rebate.",110,51620,201505
We have taken action in Europe to promote your economic security.,110,51620,201505
"We cut the EU budget for the first time ever, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion.",110,51620,201505
"We took Britain out of Eurozone bailouts, including for Greece",110,51620,201505
– the first ever return of powers from Brussels.,110,51620,201505
Our Prime Minister vetoed a new EU treaty that would have damaged Britain’s interests.,110,51620,201505
"And we have pursued a bold, positive, pro-business agenda,",401,51620,201505
"exempting smallest businesses from red tape,",401,51620,201505
"promoting free trade,",401,51620,201505
"and pushing to extend the Single Market to new sectors, like digital.",401,51620,201505
But there is much more to do.,110,51620,201505
The EU is too bureaucratic and too undemocratic.,110,51620,201505
"It interferes too much in our daily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new members joining in recent years has had a real impact on local communities.",110,51620,201505
We are clear about what we want from Europe.,110,51620,201505
We say: yes to the Single Market.,108,51620,201505
Yes to turbo-charging free trade.,108,51620,201505
Yes to working together where we are stronger together than alone.,108,51620,201505
"Yes to a family of nation states,",108,51620,201505
all part of a European Union,108,51620,201505
"– but whose interests, crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the Euro or out.",108,51620,201505
No to ‘ever closer union.’,110,51620,201505
No to a constant flow of power to Brussels.,110,51620,201505
No to unnecessary interference.,110,51620,201505
"And no, of course, to the Euro,",110,51620,201505
to participation in Eurozone bail-outs,110,51620,201505
or notions like a European Army.,110,51620,201505
It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative Government that membership of the European Union depends on the consent of the British people,110,51620,201505
– and in recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin.,110,51620,201505
"That’s why, after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in Europe,",110,51620,201505
and then ask the British people whether they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.,110,51620,201505
David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in-out referendum.,110,51620,201505
We will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome.,110,51620,201505
So the choice at this election is clear: Labour and the Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say over the EU.,110,51620,201505
UKIP can’t give you a say.,110,51620,201505
Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change in Europe,110,51620,201505
– and only the Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum.,110,51620,201505
We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain’s membership of the EU before the end of 2017.,110,51620,201505
We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU.,110,51620,201505
"And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave.",110,51620,201505
"We will honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcome.",110,51620,201505
We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone.,110,51620,201505
The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the United Kingdom.,110,51620,201505
We benefit from the Single Market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.,108,51620,201505
"Indeed, given the trade between Britain and the Eurozone countries we want to see these economies returning to growth.",108,51620,201505
But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the Single Market or in any way disadvantage the UK.,110,51620,201505
"We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it.",110,51620,201505
"We have already taken action to return around 100 powers, but we want to go further.",110,51620,201505
We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.,110,51620,201505
"And we want an end to our commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.",110,51620,201505
"Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence policy remains firmly under British national control,",104,51620,201505
maintaining NATO and the transatlantic relationship as the cornerstones of our defence and security policy.,104,51620,201505
We will scrap Labour's Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK.,204,51620,201505
"The Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights, which we signed up to in the original European Convention on Human Rights.",201,51620,201505
"It will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society.",201,51620,201505
"But it will reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law being used for more and more purposes, and often with little regard for the rights of wider society.",204,51620,201505
Among other things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.,204,51620,201505
"We want an EU that helps Britain move ahead, not one that holds us back.",401,51620,201505
"We have already succeeded in exempting our smallest businesses from new EU regulations,",401,51620,201505
"and kicked-off negotiations for a massive EU trade deal with the USA, which could be worth billions of pounds to the UK economy.",401,51620,201505
We will build on this.,401,51620,201505
"We want to preserve the integrity of the Single Market, by insisting on protections for those countries that have kept their own currencies.",406,51620,201505
"We want to expand the Single Market, breaking down the remaining barriers to trade and ensuring that new sectors are opened up to British firms.",401,51620,201505
"We want to ensure that new rules target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services industry,",403,51620,201505
while safeguarding Britain as a global centre of excellence in finance.,401,51620,201505
So we will resist EU attempts to restrict legitimate financial services activities.,401,51620,201505
"We will press for lower EU spending,",110,51620,201505
"further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds,",110,51620,201505
and for EU money to be focused on promoting jobs and growth.,110,51620,201505
Everything we do around the world will be driven by a determination to protect your security and help you prosper.,601,51620,201505
"We will: ensure Britain is a major player on the world stage,",601,51620,201505
"using diplomacy to protect your interests, uphold British values",601,51620,201505
and tackle threats to your security and prosperity,605,51620,201505
"help generate new trade, investment and job opportunities, to benefit you and your family",410,51620,201505
maintain our world class Armed Forces so they continue to guarantee your security,104,51620,201505
uphold our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international development.,107,51620,201505
Economic security and national security are two sides of the same coin.,601,51620,201505
"Without one, you cannot have the other.",601,51620,201505
"Our prosperity depends upon Britain remaining an active, outward-looking nation, one that is engaged with the world, not looking in on itself.",601,51620,201505
We will maintain Britain’s strong global role and our capacity to project British power and values around the world.,601,51620,201505
Labour’s Great Recession weakened Britain on the world stage.,601,51620,201505
"They left a £38 billion black hole in the defence budget,",104,51620,201505
"went 12 years without conducting a Strategic Defence Review,",104,51620,201505
"and, at times, failed to provide our Armed Forces with the equipment they needed in Afghanistan.",104,51620,201505
"They shut down over 30 British diplomatic missions,",107,51620,201505
"failed to plan properly for Iraq’s reconstruction,",107,51620,201505
"ignored trade and investment opportunities overseas,",401,51620,201505
and neglected vital relationships.,107,51620,201505
We have strengthened Britain’s influence in the world.,601,51620,201505
"The National Security Council that we established ensures proper, strategic decision-making at the top of government.",104,51620,201505
"We have boosted exports to emerging markets,",401,51620,201505
"opened new diplomatic posts in Africa, Asia and Latin America,",107,51620,201505
and led the world in promoting women’s rights and tackling sexual violence in conflict.,201,51620,201505
We have balanced the defence budget,414,51620,201505
and set out a clear strategy to defend our nation for the long term.,104,51620,201505
We and our allies face major challenges:,107,51620,201505
"Islamist extremism, an aggressive Russia, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, nuclear proliferation and infectious diseases.",107,51620,201505
A Conservative Government will tackle these challenges.,305,51620,201505
"We will use our membership of NATO,",104,51620,201505
"the EU,",108,51620,201505
"the Commonwealth,",101,51620,201505
"our UN Security Council seat,",107,51620,201505
"our Special Relationship with the USA,",101,51620,201505
"our intelligence agencies,",104,51620,201505
"vital institutions like the BBC World Service and British Council,",601,51620,201505
"and the strong personal links between our diaspora communities and other countries, to achieve the best for Britain.",601,51620,201505
We will back this up with UK military power,104,51620,201505
and international aid.,107,51620,201505
"Our long-term economic plan will ensure we have the economic strength to maintain our world-class Armed Forces,",104,51620,201505
to uphold our national security,104,51620,201505
and project power globally.,104,51620,201505
Aid helps prevent failed states from becoming havens for terrorists.,107,51620,201505
"It builds long-term markets for our businesses,",107,51620,201505
"by promoting global prosperity,",107,51620,201505
and reduces migration pressures.,107,51620,201505
"So we will maintain our commitment to tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.",107,51620,201505
We will tackle global terrorism and the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism,104,51620,201505
"while taking a patient, long-term approach to preventing conflict and state failure.",105,51620,201505
"We will work with our partners to address threats to UK security,",107,51620,201505

"Over the last five years, we have used foreign policy to boost our prosperity.",410,51620,201505
UK exports to China have more than doubled since 2009.,410,51620,201505

The importance of planning cannot be over-estimated.,303,51621,201505
"It impacts everything from economic development (airport runways, new retail outlets, factory expansions) to daily lives (neighbours building extensions to their homes, replacement dwellings).",303,51621,201505
"In short, it is key to our quality of life.",503,51621,201505
"We believe planning should achieve sustainable development,",501,51621,201505
whilst promoting economic and societal improvement.,503,51621,201505
"With the transfer of planning powers to our eleven new Councils, local people now have a greater opportunity than ever before to shape the look and functionality of their communities.",606,51621,201505
We will: Ensure a balance between sustainability and economic considerations in planning decisions;,416,51621,201505
Encourage greater use of land that has been previously developed;,501,51621,201505
Ensure that our Councils use their new planning powers to deliver more energy efficient buildings.,501,51621,201505
Northern Ireland’s countryside is coveted internationally and cherished locally.,501,51621,201505
"That requires that a balance must be reached to maximise the dual responsibilities of maximising the economic and tourism potential,",416,51621,201505
and our duty to preserve the countryside for future generations to enjoy.,501,51621,201505
We wish to reverse the unfortunate trend of recent years that has seen statutory bodies acting reactively.,416,51621,201505
They must be proactive.,416,51621,201505
"Instead of schemes such ASSIs (Areas of Special Scientific Interest) being allocated only to meet targets, we will ensure that communities are given the real opportunity to feed into the discussions on how best to protect their local landscapes.",501,51621,201505
"In addition, real focus is needed on preserving our historic built environment.",501,51621,201505
Buildings can be restored but if lost they can never truly be replaced.,501,51621,201505
We will: Tackle robustly the threat posed to our local biodiversity by invasive species;,501,51621,201505
"Work effectively with the European Union on policies such as the European Birds and Habitats Directive in order to ensure that breaches, such as those on Strangford Lough, are avoided;",501,51621,201505
Give local communities and land owners greater say in the designation of lands.,501,51621,201505
"Too often, animals in Northern Ireland are subjected to cruel and unnecessary suffering.",501,51621,201505
"Despite repeated media exposés of abuse of sickening proportions, animal welfare remains a major issue here.",501,51621,201505
Previous attempts to tackle the problem have clearly not been enough.,501,51621,201505
Further action is needed.,501,51621,201505
"The Ulster Unionist Party strongly believes in the principle that securing animal welfare and respecting the rights of those who engage in country sports, such as shooting, are values that should be mutually dependent - not exclusive.",501,51621,201505
We will: Overhaul the Welfare of Animals Act to deliver greater numbers of successful prosecutions;,501,51621,201505
Seek to regulate the sale of live poultry and domestic pets in open and indoor markets;,501,51621,201505
Review the online sale and distribution of cats and dogs;,501,51621,201505
Ensure all animals are stunned pre-slaughter with strict enforcement by DARD.,501,51621,201505
Our ambition for the people of Northern Ireland is simply put.,410,51621,201505
The Ulster Unionist Party wants Northern Ireland to be the most attractive region in Europe in which to do business.,410,51621,201505
Why? Because to succeed will make our people more prosperous and we believe that will be transformational for our society.,410,51621,201505
There was a time when this corner of the United Kingdom was a major economic powerhouse.,410,51621,201505
It led the world in ship building;,410,51621,201505
we had the globe’s largest rope works;,410,51621,201505
our textile industry was vibrant;,410,51621,201505
we produced brilliant engineers,410,51621,201505
and agriculture was a staple industry.,410,51621,201505
The Ulster Unionist Party wants Northern Ireland to once again establish itself as a major economic powerhouse.,410,51621,201505
"We may always require a Block Grant from Westminster,",410,51621,201505
"but we should aspire to be less dependent, generating our own wealth,",410,51621,201505
"and with it, restoring pride and a sense of purpose to our people.",606,51621,201505
"When we talk about the economy, it boils down to how much money our people have in their back pockets.",410,51621,201505
"In simple terms, there is a huge prosperity gap between ourselves in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.",410,51621,201505
"If people in Great Britain have £1 in their pockets, our citizens have only 77 pence.",410,51621,201505
"To close that gap, we need to start generating serious wealth.",410,51621,201505
Giving Stormont the power to vary the rate of Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland was an Ulster Unionist idea.,301,51621,201505
"We regret it was not resolved sooner, because it could and should have been, but that is in the past and the challenge now is to move swiftly to agree the Rate and Date.",402,51621,201505
We support: A rate of 12.5%.,402,51621,201505
"This matches the current rate in the Republic of Ireland and represents a 7.5% positive differential with GB, now that the UK-wide rate has dropped to 20%;",402,51621,201505
"Introducing the rate at the earliest possible date, which is 1st April 2017;",402,51621,201505
"Encouraging Invest NI, supported by Leaders of all the Executive Parties and Northern Ireland’s business spokespersons, to start immediately marketing Northern Ireland to Foreign Direct Investors,",402,51621,201505
"not least in the USA, where the Corporation Tax rate is 35%.",101,51621,201505
The Ulster Unionist Party never considered a lower rate of Corporation Tax as a silver bullet for our economy.,410,51621,201505
"Rather, it is the centre piece in a basket of measures, including: An appropriately skilled workforce;",410,51621,201505
Sufficient A grade office accommodation to meet demand;,410,51621,201505
Fast track planning for major economic initiatives.,410,51621,201505
"In order for Northern Ireland to meet its potential to make its people more prosperous, we need a new economic model;",403,51621,201505
"a model that is not so overly-dependent on the public sector, or which stifles private sector growth, or ignores the massive potential of social enterprises, which make up the Third Sector, the so-called “not for profit” businesses that plough profit back into the organisation and the communities they serve.",403,51621,201505
"In order to grow the economy in Northern Ireland we will: Seek to deliver the latent ambition among our business community for a Northern Ireland-owned bank, focused on promoting and advancing the rebalancing of our economy;",410,51621,201505
Support long-term business investment by opening up access to finance.,402,51621,201505
We will also seek a formal review of the market restrictions for new non-bank sources of finance;,403,51621,201505

This is especially relevant for organisations that rely on funding from sources such as the European Social Fund;,403,51621,201505
Keep the interests of businesses and employers at the heart of the decision making process.,405,51621,201505
The Ulster Unionist Party believes now is the time to start commencing the transition to a single education system where children of all faiths and none learn together.,608,51621,201505
"There would be no more sectors, no more enforced social segregation.",608,51621,201505

"That means every child is cherished, not just the academic boys and girls.",506,51621,201505
"When Martin McGuinness became the first Minister of Education post the 1998 Agreement, he listened when you told him you did not like the 11-Plus Examination, but he closed his ears when you also said you wanted selection, because life involves selection; for jobs, sports teams, performing arts - name it, you will face selection!",506,51621,201505
"Our discussions and broader research with business leaders leaves us in no doubt: if we are serious about closing the prosperity gap, we need to align our education system to three key questions:",506,51621,201505
"What ability, creativity and talent lies within the individual child;",506,51621,201505
How does that fit within making our people more prosperous:,506,51621,201505
What do we need to change to make it happen?,506,51621,201505
"To improve the prospects of our young people, we will: Match Scotland’s record where 80% of day to day expenditure is managed by School Principals supporting children, by cutting administrative costs and putting more of the budget into frontline, classroom teaching;",506,51621,201505
Resolve the post primary transfer stalemate.,303,51621,201505
The current commercialised nature of the test means the State has lost control of State schools;,303,51621,201505
"Recognise your child’s education is about more than their transfer to post-primary education and bring forward a holistic package of teaching, learning and support.",506,51621,201505
Our commitments: We will target schools in deprived communities and introduce a pupil premium.,503,51621,201505
It is abhorrent that successive Sinn Fein Education Ministers have failed to break the cycle of educational underachievement in these areas;,503,51621,201505
"We will push hard to develop a skills-based agenda based around the STEM subjects -  Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths;",411,51621,201505

We will amend the Fair Employment and Treatment Order to repeal the exemption for teachers and end the requirement for primary school teachers in the Maintained sector to hold a Catholic Certificate in religious education;,604,51621,201505
We will end the postcode lottery for pre-school places.,503,51621,201505
"Currently, that allows the Government to boast huge success rates in placement offers, with no acknowledgement of the impracticality of families availing of same and the consequent lowering of the percentage of placements accepted.",503,51621,201505
The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 increased low-end wages for several million workers effectively overnight.,412,51621,201505
"However, as a result of only modest increases up until 2014, the value of the minimum wage has fallen significantly in real terms since 2008.",412,51621,201505
"We support the principle of the Living Wage, but given the Northern Ireland economy is constituted almost exclusively by micro and SMEs, for whom the Living Wage would represent an existential threat, the practical step for Northern Ireland at this stage is to restore the Minimum Wage to the position originally intended.",412,51621,201505
We will: Increase the national minimum wage over the next 3 years to rebalance the shortfalls from previous years;,412,51621,201505
Expect any company benefitting from the 12.5% rate of Corporation Tax to pay the Living Wage from April 2017;,412,51621,201505

"Oppose reintroducing the 50% top rate of income tax for people earning over £150,000 as previous experience shows an increased rate could actually lead to a reduced total tax take.",403,51621,201505
The current 20% value added tax rate is crippling two of our key industrial sectors: Construction and Tourism.,402,51621,201505
"The Ulster Unionist Party has repeatedly argued the need for concessionary VAT rates for these sectors, to help rebalance our economy and grow our private sector.",402,51621,201505
"We believe Northern Ireland should learn from the experience of the Isle of Man, where a 5% VAT rate has applied since 1995 to hospitality, and from 1999 to aspects of construction, both with identifiable benefits to their economy.",402,51621,201505
"The Tynwald government, aided by HM Treasury, successfully lobbied the EU for a concessionary VAT rate for the Repair Maintenance and Improvement (RM&I) of existing dwellings.",402,51621,201505
"RM&I covers all activities to existing dwellings, from relatively minor works such as painting and decorating, to the more major, including extensions and conversions.",402,51621,201505

Reducing the viability of the black / shadow / informal economy;,402,51621,201505
Generating a perception of positive momentum and hope.,402,51621,201505
"While there is no reliable, discrete data for Northern Ireland, a forecast by Experian (global information forecasters) predicted that had a UK-wide 5% VAT rate for RM&I applied in 2010, this would have seen estimated revenue loss to the HM Treasury of between £102 and £508 million, but a stimulus effect of £1.4 billion, to include the multiplier effect.",402,51621,201505
"The Isle of Man has also operated a concessionary VAT rate on hotel accommodation, which has been judged to be a direct stimulus to that sector.",402,51621,201505
"Given Northern Ireland’s tourism competes with the Republic of Ireland, which enjoys a 9% VAT rate for this type of purchase, the 11% differential is clearly off-putting for potential visitors to Northern Ireland.",402,51621,201505
"The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, representing 85% of the hotel sector in Northern Ireland, report in their Tourism 2020 analysis, that the UK has the third highest VAT rate in Europe and is only one of four EU states that does not have a concessionary VAT rate for hotel accommodation.",402,51621,201505
"The potential benefits for Northern Ireland are measured in significant boosts to GDP, job creation, and additional tax take.",410,51621,201505

"The target of £50m per annum by the time the Open Championship returns to Northern Ireland, possibly in 2019, should be more ambitious.",410,51621,201505

Promote apprenticeships using the ‘Unlocking creativity’ programme as a model to release individual creativity and ensure young people are prepared for careers in creative industries.,411,51621,201505
"The agri-food sector is Northern Ireland’s largest indigenous employer, with 47,000 people working in farming and a further 27,000 working in food and drinks processing.",703,51621,201505
It is now worth well over £1Billion a year.,703,51621,201505
However despite the proven potential the Northern Ireland Executive has only recently started to commence its much lauded ‘Going for Growth Strategy’.,703,51621,201505
This malaise inevitably limited the growth of the sector in recent years.,703,51621,201505

"Whilst prices have only just started to recover, we are still not building anywhere near enough homes.",503,51621,201505
"Over the next ten years, Northern Ireland needs 12,500 new homes per annum just to keep up with demand, yet we’re not building even two thirds of that.",503,51621,201505

"By the same token, we reaffirm that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, as endorsed by the people of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, voting in the 1998 Referendum.",601,51621,201505

"But this must be balanced by consideration of the cost of the UK’s potential withdrawal from membership of the EU, not least the economic cost, given continuing trade with EU member states is essential for our economy.",108,51621,201505
"It must also take account of the non-financial benefits of a strong, united Europe, not least in standing up to terrorism and belligerent nations outwith the EU.",108,51621,201505

We must help the PSNI address this.,605,51621,201505

"and zero business rates for over 70,000 Welsh companies",402,51901,201505
We want the decisions that affect us made here in Wales //-,301,51901,201505
not by a Westminster government that doesn’t prioritise Wales.,301,51901,201505
Wales must be treated as a nation and have the powers to act as a nation.,602,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru believes that Wales is a sovereign country, and that power belongs in the hands of the people of Wales.",602,51901,201505
It’s only fair that Wales should have the same powers as Scotland.,301,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru were the first party to respond to the Silk Commission and the Independence Referendum in Scotland, publishing our ‘Bring our Government Home’ paper and tabling far-reaching amendments to the Wales Act to give powers to Wales.",301,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru has long made the case for giving the Welsh Government more powers.,301,51901,201505
"In our submission to the Silk Commission we called for job-creating powers in finance, responsibility for energy, responsibility for energy, and criminal justice.",301,51901,201505
"As part of the One Wales Government from 2007 to 2011 in Wales, we led the campaign for the 2011 referendum, where nearly two-thirds supported giving the Welsh Government lawmaking powers for the first time.",301,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru calls for the following powers to become Welsh government responsibilities immediately:PolicingCriminal Justice and the courtsSentencing, Legal Aid, Crown Prosecution Service and judiciaryPrison service and probation servicePublic Sector pay and conditionsElements of Social ProtectionAdditional Planning PowersBroadcastingNatural Resources and EnergyAll licensing and oversight powers for the exploitation of natural resourcesThe Crown EstateWater, including seweragePorts and harboursMaritime Coastguard AgencyWales and Border rail franchiseNetwork Rail operations in WalesSpeed limits and drink drive limitsBus and taxi regulation",301,51901,201505
"We want to see the full transfer to the Welsh Government of the powers recommended in both reports by the Commission on Devolution in Wales as quickly as possible so it will be possible to create a better, fairer and more prosperous society for the people of Wales.",301,51901,201505
Our proposed reserved powers model would set out which powers are in the hands of the people of Wales and which still lie with Westminster.,301,51901,201505
"All powers should be given to Wales except those the Welsh people agree should be kept by Westminster, as is the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland.",202,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will push for a written constitution for Wales which will be guided by its citizens not by politicians.,602,51901,201505
"Developing the Welsh constitution in this way will enable us to consider the society we want to build, not just where the powers should be held.",602,51901,201505
Much can be done to improve the way the four nations work together for the benefit of their peoples.,301,51901,201505
"The Joint Ministerial Committees, where Ministers of all four nations meet, can allow co-operation in areas of mutual interest, such as those which are decided by Westminster alone but which impact upon all four nations.",301,51901,201505
"The British-Irish Council should develop further to improve relationships and co-operation between the countries of these islands, regardless of their constitutional status, with a roving EU-type presidency between them and formal structures for better co-operation on shared assets and developing the Common Travel Area.",107,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru wants a successful economy for Wales, where everybody can maximise their potential.",410,51901,201505
This will be a growing economy where everyone benefits - not just the richest 1%.,403,51901,201505
Investment and planning will provide opportunities for everybody to have a well-paid job and a good work-life balance.,403,51901,201505
"As the economy improves, Plaid Cymru believes that everyone should benefit.",403,51901,201505
"Unlike the Westminster parties, we do not support the continuation of ‘austerity’ policies - the cuts that have had such a detrimental effect on our way of life and hit the poorest in our society the hardest.",503,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru has consistently opposed the austerity cuts forced through the UK Parliament by the major UK parties because they lead to severe cuts in funding for Wales.,408,51901,201505
"Recognising the failure of UK economic policy, we published our plans for an Economic Fairness Bill to level up wealth across the UK, in both geographical and individual terms.",404,51901,201505
"Our ‘Plan C for Cymru’ economic plan, published in 2012, sets out how Wales can improve its economy using the economic powers we currently have -",404,51901,201505
but the current Welsh Government are failing to use successfully.,305,51901,201505
"Our Budget deal in 2012 helped secure £40m of finance for thousands of new apprenticeships across Wales, training people for skilled jobs.",411,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru has successfully secured funding for important projects such as the Menai Science Park which will grow the Welsh economy,410,51901,201505
and create new jobs.,701,51901,201505
"So that wealth is shared out more fairly within the UK, and to ensure that Wales receives its fair share of public investment, Plaid Cymru will introduce an Economic Fairness Bill to rebalance the wealth of the UK.",403,51901,201505
This means that the UK Government would have to always assess the impact upon Wales of its economic plans before they’re put in place.,403,51901,201505
"We will create 50,000 jobs in Wales by giving more Welsh public sector contracts to companies working in Wales,",406,51901,201505
so that our economy benefits more from the £4.3bn spent by the Welsh public sector each year.,403,51901,201505
"By increasing business rates relief in Wales, more than 83,000 small and medium sized businesses will be helped",402,51901,201505
"and 70,000 businesses will pay no business rates at all.",402,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will create a Welsh Development Bank whose primary role would be to ensure adequate credit lines for Welsh businesses to maintain businesses and support expansion to create additional jobs within Wales.,402,51901,201505

Plaid Cymru will set up a Green Skills College to develop the skills needed to make our economy more environmentally-friendly,501,51901,201505
whilst creating research and development and manufacturing jobs to meet this need through a ‘Green New Deal’ for householders and business.,501,51901,201505
We will support and encourage Welsh businesses to use energy and natural resources efficiently.,501,51901,201505
"A new manufacturing strategy for Wales will be developed, taking advantage of the existing skills in our communities and universities to create skilled and high-value jobs through research, development and manufacturing.",411,51901,201505
Investment projects in Wales must be better facilitated and managed.,402,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru will give the Welsh Government the powers to guarantee major investment projects for Wales to give security that they will be carried out, with appropriate scrutiny of this investment to ensure it is well spent.",402,51901,201505
We support the Welsh Government having sufficient borrowing powers to invest in Welsh infrastructure projects and will increase those contained in the Wales Act.,301,51901,201505
We will commit 1% extra of UK GDP to infrastructure investment each year.,411,51901,201505
This would secure £800m to invest in Welsh infrastructure projects each year.,411,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will also introduce our ‘Build 4 Wales’ programme to borrow funding for Welsh infrastructure projects,411,51901,201505
and create a centre that specializes in major infrastructure project management.,411,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru will encourage alternative company models to the limited company/plc model, and will consider the benefits of establishing a Welsh Institute of Employee Ownership to encourage the creation of companies which are owned or controlled by employees.",701,51901,201505

and those who currently find it difficult to get a job.,701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will increase the minimum wage to be the same level as the Living Wage over the next Parliament.,412,51901,201505
"This will ensure a pay rise for more Welsh workers by 2020,",701,51901,201505
and could create new jobs in Wales through increased spending in local communities.,701,51901,201505
We will ensure that more companies alleged to pay below the minimum wage will be investigated and prosecuted.,412,51901,201505
We want to end exploitative zero hours contracts that tie workers to a company while not giving them a guaranteed weekly income.,701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru has opposed plans to cut workers’ rights that would make it easier for bad bosses to fire staff.,701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru tabled amendments in the National Assembly for Wales to ban the use of zero-hours contracts in healthcare and in agricultural work.,701,51901,201505
These were defeated by the Welsh Government.,0,51901,201505
"We have fought against cuts in the public sector, recognising that these provide high quality and well-paid jobs in otherwise economically challenged parts of Wales.",409,51901,201505
"While recognising the value of any work during difficult economic times,",701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru has highlighted the need for better paid jobs and a strong private sector so as to avoid under-employment.,701,51901,201505
One of the biggest challenges we currently face in Wales is getting people back into work.,701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru disagrees with the Westminster parties who say that people are to blame for the situation in which they find themselves,701,51901,201505
and we reject the privatisation of schemes to help people into work.,413,51901,201505
"To help reduce unemployment, we will help people who have the most difficulty finding work, including those with a disability and who have limited skills and qualifications, to find a suitable job.",701,51901,201505
This will be achieved by dealing with people fairly and by focusing on what individuals can achieve on a day to day basis without the threat of sanctions.,701,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will tailor job search and creation services to the needs of Wales by giving the job-search functions of Job Centre Plus to the Welsh Government.,301,51901,201505
"As the WelshGovernment has responsibility for education, training and skills and the performance of the Welsh economy, it makes sense to integrate these with job-search functions.",301,51901,201505
"We support the European Union’s Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who is out of work for more than four months,",701,51901,201505

"Supervisory boards of major companies who employ more than 500 staff will include elected employees, to ensure scrutiny of the management in the interests of the company as a whole, building on established practices in industrially successful countries such as Germany.",405,51901,201505
"A ‘fair pay’ scheme will be introduced to link the pay of everybody within a company, to prevent spiraling executive pay whilst other staff receive no pay rise, following a commission to determine the most appropriate level of comparable renumeration.",503,51901,201505
Plaid Cymru will create an Independent Commission to consider industrial relations policy and will legislate against ‘blacklisting’.,503,51901,201505
"We will review the current levels of Employment Tribunal Fees implemented by the UK Government, whose high costs prevent workers from getting access to justice.",503,51901,201505
"Plaid Cymru believes that everybody should pay a fair share of tax so that we in Wales can all share excellent, world-class public services.",503,51901,201505
"That means that those who earn most - as individuals or as companies - must make a fair contribution, just like those who earn lower incomes.",503,51901,201505

Trustees would be appointed by the Welsh Government and the appointment process including public hearings held by the National Assembly for Wales.,301,51901,201505
"Responsibility for S4C, the world’s only Welsh language channel, would transfer to the National Assembly for Wales, as would the funding for the channel that is currently with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.",502,51901,201505

It’s time to put fairness and equality back at the heart of government.,503,51902,201505
With a strong SNP team at Westminster we can use our influence to end the needless pain of Tory cuts.,301,51902,201505
"And we can campaign to secure more money for health,",504,51902,201505
education,506,51902,201505
and childcare.,504,51902,201505
Here are our key priorities to make Scotland stronger at Westminster:,301,51902,201505
SNP  MPs  will  demand  an  end  to  austerity.,409,51902,201505
We  oppose  further spending  cuts  and  propose  modest  spending  increases   of  0.5  per  cent  above  inflation   in  each  year  of  the  next  Parliament.,409,51902,201505
"Under our plan, the deficit will still reduce each year,",414,51902,201505
"but there will be at least an additional £140 billion across the UK to invest in skills and infrastructure,",411,51902,201505
"in our NHS and other public services,",504,51902,201505
and in measures to protect the vulnerable and lift people out of poverty.,503,51902,201505
"We will also vote for the following revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50 pence top tax rate,",409,51902,201505
"a tax on bankers' bonuses,",409,51902,201505
"a bank levy,",409,51902,201505
"a mansion tax,",409,51902,201505
"a crackdown on tax avoidance,",605,51902,201505
the abolition of 'nondom' status,409,51902,201505
and reversal of the married couple’s tax allowance.,503,51902,201505
We will meet the NHS funding challenge laid down in the report of the NHS Chief Executive in England – the Stevens Report and vote for an increase in NHS spending across the UK of £24 billion by 202021 £9.5 billion above inflation.,504,51902,201505
This will deliver a total boost to the NHS Scotland budget of £2 billion by 202021.,504,51902,201505
SNP MPs will also vote against any further privatisation of the NHS in England and back any moves to restore it to a fully public service.,413,51902,201505
We will support a singletier pension of £160 per week,504,51902,201505
"and vote to continue the triple lock, guaranteeing that pensions will always rise by inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent whichever is the highest.",504,51902,201505
We will also vote to protect the Winter Fuel Allowance.,504,51902,201505
We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit – introduced to reward people for saving for their pension,504,51902,201505
and we will seek a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.,504,51902,201505
We will oppose plans for a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons,105,51902,201505
and seek to build an alliance in the House of Commons against Trident renewal.,105,51902,201505
"We will vote for the £100 billion that the Westminster parties plan to spend on Trident renewal to be invested instead in better childcare, education and the NHS.",105,51902,201505
We will vote to increase the minimum wage to £8.70 by 2020.,412,51902,201505
We will also support measures to extend the Living Wage across the UK.,412,51902,201505
"The Scottish Government already pays the Living Wage to all of its own employees and to those covered by its pay policy we will call on,",412,51902,201505
"and vote for, the UK government to adopt the same policy.",412,51902,201505
It is estimated that an additional one million children across the UK will be living in poverty by 2020.,504,51902,201505
"That is unacceptable and would mean an additional 100,000 children in Scotland growing up in poverty.",504,51902,201505
That is why we will vigorously oppose plans for further cuts in Child Benefit and Tax Credits allowing these payments to erode in value simply pushes more children into poverty.,504,51902,201505
"Instead, we will vote to increase benefits at least in line with CPI inflation//,",504,51902,201505
to ensure that the incomes of the poorest in society do not fall even further behind the cost of living.,503,51902,201505
And we will support an increase in free childcare to 30 hours per week by 2020.,504,51902,201505
We will vote to block plans to cut Disability Living Allowance by £3 billion across the UK by 201718.,504,51902,201505
Scotland’s share of that cut is around £310 million per year.,504,51902,201505
"These cuts would see more than 100,000 disabled people in Scotland – and one million across the UK – losing over £1,100 a year in the support that they rely on to live independent lives.",503,51902,201505
We will use our influence to make sure that these cuts do not proceed,504,51902,201505
and that disabled people are given the support they deserve.,503,51902,201505
We will also support an increase in Carer’s Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.,504,51902,201505
Those in receipt of Carer’s Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.,504,51902,201505
We will vote for the immediate abolition of the unfair Bedroom Tax.,503,51902,201505
Abolishing the Bedroom Tax would mean that the £35 million a year that the Scottish Government is spending to compensate those affected by it would be available to spend on other priorities.,503,51902,201505
We would invest that money in measures to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.,503,51902,201505
We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland,506,51902,201505
and support the reduction of tuition fees across the UK.,506,51902,201505
"We will extend the availability of Educational Maintenance Allowance in Scotland to an additional 10,000 school pupils",506,51902,201505
"and 12,000 part time college students.",506,51902,201505
"At least 330,000 Scottish jobs – around one in seven of all jobs are dependent on our membership of the single market.",108,51902,201505
That is why we will oppose a referendum on membership of the EU.,108,51902,201505
Being part of Europe is good for business,108,51902,201505
and it supports jobs in Scotland and across the UK.,108,51902,201505
"If an in/out EU referendum does go ahead, we will seek to amend the legislation to ensure that no constituent part of the UK can be taken out of the EU against its will.",108,51902,201505
"We will propose a 'double majority' rule meaning that unless England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each vote to leave the EU, the UK would remain a member state.",108,51902,201505
Diversity is one of Scotland's great strengths.,607,51902,201505
"Effective immigration controls are important,",403,51902,201505
but we must also remember that those who have come to Scotland from other countries make a significant contribution to our economy and our society.,607,51902,201505
We will support sensible immigration policies that meet our economic needs,403,51902,201505
"and, as a priority, we will seek the reintroduction of the post study work visa, so that those we have helped educate are able, if they so choose, to make a contribution to our economy.",403,51902,201505
There is a substantial shortfall of affordable houses for rent across the UK.,503,51902,201505
"The Scottish Government is on track to meet the commitment to 30,000 new affordable homes by 2016, but more needs to be done.",503,51902,201505
"We will back investment in an annual house building target across the UK of 100,000 affordable homes a year.",503,51902,201505
We will also continue our support for Help to Buy and shared equity to help people get a foot on the housing ladder.,503,51902,201505
We will support targeted reductions to employer’s National Insurance contributions to support job creation and the extension of the Living Wage.,402,51902,201505
"We will support an increase in the Employment Allowance from £2,000 per business per year to £6,000 per business per year, reducing the cost of creating and maintaining jobs.",402,51902,201505
We will support this change being phased in over the fouryear period to 201920.,402,51902,201505
In work poverty is a modern day scandal that must be tackled.,503,51902,201505
We support increases in the personal tax allowance,503,51902,201505
but will also back an increase in the Work Allowance – the amount people are allowed to earn before their benefit is cut – of 20 per cent.,701,51902,201505
This will encourage people back into work by reducing the amount the state claws back – making work pay more.,701,51902,201505
We will also support tough action to end exploitative zero hours contracts.,701,51902,201505
We will support lower energy bills for consumers by pushing for the Energy Company Obligation to be funded through general taxation and not as a levy on energy bills.,403,51902,201505
We will also support new powers to make sure that energy companies pass on the benefits of lower prices to consumers.,403,51902,201505
We will also press for a change to the transmission charging system that is penalising Scottish generators,402,51902,201505
and threatening the future of Longannet power station.,402,51902,201505
"We will call on, and vote for, the UK Government to adopt Scotland’s ambitious carbon reduction targets.",501,51902,201505
We will also continue to support a moratorium on fracking.,416,51902,201505
We believe that women should be properly represented in public life.,503,51902,201505
"We will push for 50:50 representation on public and private boards, //`",503,51902,201505
and ensure that women are fairly treated at work with action to secure equal pay,503,51902,201505
and greater support for working parents with increased paternity leave.,503,51902,201505
Westminster badly needs to be reformed.,202,51902,201505
An unelected second chamber is not acceptable in a modern democracy.,202,51902,201505
Those with no democratic mandate should not be writing the laws of the land,202,51902,201505
and SNP MPs will vote for the abolition of the House of Lords.,202,51902,201505
We will also vote for the replacement of the first past the post voting system with proportional representation.,202,51902,201505
The SNP will always support independence but that is not what this election is about.,602,51902,201505
It is about making Scotland stronger.,602,51902,201505
We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that promises made during the referendum are delivered.,602,51902,201505
"We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.",602,51902,201505
We believe that these proposals do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.,602,51902,201505
We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.,301,51902,201505
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals has demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would underpin it would take a number of years.",301,51902,201505
SNP MPs will work to secure the best deal for Scotland.,301,51902,201505
"In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,",412,51902,201505

"business taxes,",402,51902,201505

"If there is an antiTory majority in the House of Commons, we will vote in a motion of confidence against a Tory government getting off the ground.",305,51902,201505
The SNP is the third largest party in the UK following a surge in new members since the referendum.,305,51902,201505
"80,000 have joined since September 2014, with total membership now over 105,000.",305,51902,201505
The SNP’s 59 candidates includes prominent Yes campaigners and others who have only just joined the party.,305,51902,201505

and making life better for people across our country.,503,51902,201505
"This is what underpins our policies on public finances, on education, health, housing and social justice",503,51902,201505
and our support for the Scottish Parliament having more of the powers it needs.,301,51902,201505
"We want more people in rewarding, well paid work.",701,51902,201505
"We want stronger local economies,",301,51902,201505
with job opportunities for our young people close to home,701,51902,201505
So we can retain the important links of family and community that add to the strength and wellbeing of our society.,606,51902,201505
But this is not economic growth for its own sake.,416,51902,201505
It must be sustainable and with the benefits shared across society.,416,51902,201505
"It will be wealth creation so we can, once and for all, address the unacceptable levels of inequality in Scottish society.",416,51902,201505
"As we set out in this manifesto, we will be able to build Scotland’s success and deliver on our ambitions by harnessing the energy of our people, by building our skills and using them to the full, and by making the most of our nation’s great natural wealth and many competitive and comparative advantages.",601,51902,201505
"The more SNP MPs that are elected to Westminster, the louder Scotland's voice will be in the decisions that are taken there",602,51902,201505
and that means we can secure the best deal for Scotland and a more progressive approach for the benefit of people across the UK.,301,51902,201505
"SNP MPs, backed by hundreds of thousands of new supporters many voting SNP at Westminster for the very first time can make a real difference to the direction our country takes in the years ahead.",301,51902,201505
With greater influence for Scotland at Westminster,301,51902,201505
"and new powers for our parliament in Edinburgh,",301,51902,201505
there is so much more we can achieve for the people of Scotland.,602,51902,201505
SNP MPs will: Make sure Westminster works better for the people of Scotland,602,51902,201505
The biggest threat to Scotland’s public services and our social fabric is the ongoing Tory and Labour obsession with austerity cuts to vital public spending.,504,51902,201505
That is why we propose responsible increases in public spending.,504,51902,201505
We will support increases in infrastructure investment,411,51902,201505
as part of our plans to generate new jobs,701,51902,201505
"and support higher levels of growth,",410,51902,201505
and we will work to open access to finances for businesses looking to expand.,402,51902,201505
Our approach is to secure a fair deal for all,503,51902,201505
"with those on the very highest incomes contributing a little bit more to ensure that we can continue to deliver universal, free public services",503,51902,201505
and protect the most vulnerable from the impacts of poverty.,503,51902,201505
"We back the planned expansion of childcare with 30hours a week of free nursery education for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds,",504,51902,201505
providing the best possible start in life for younger Scots and making life easier for their parents.,504,51902,201505
"We support a big increase in NHS spending in Scotland, and across the UK, to enable the Scottish government to continue improving our health service.",504,51902,201505
Our plans will mean £2 billion more for our NHS by 202021.,504,51902,201505
We will also use our votes at Westminster to protect the health service in all parts of the UK from privatisation.,413,51902,201505
"We agree that we need to maximise opportunities for our young people and support an increase to 30,000 Modern Apprenticeships",411,51902,201505
"and the expansion of the Education Maintenance Allowance to an extra 22,000 school pupils and students.",506,51902,201505
We will: Propose different choices on spending so we can protect fundamental public services and ensure irreparable damage isn’t done to the fabric of society.,409,51902,201505
This will allow modest increases in public spending in each year of the next parliament,409,51902,201505
– it will also see deficit fall every year as a share of income.,414,51902,201505
"Argue for a fairer approach on taxation, with those with the very most contributing a little bit more",503,51902,201505
"Focus on investment to support economic growth and the creation of a more productive, highskill, highwage economy",410,51902,201505
"Seek to enshrine in law key principles of future financial management, including elimination of the deficit and balanced ‘current account’ spending",414,51902,201505
"by stimulating growth in the economy,",410,51902,201505
as part of a medium term strategy to ensure prudent levels of debt are achieved,414,51902,201505
"Support the creation of a sovereign wealth fund so that we create a financial buffer for the future, protecting public finances in times of crisis",414,51902,201505
We are working hard to make life better for people across Scottish society and the plans we set out in this manifesto will see some new and important gains.,503,51902,201505
"For our NHS – we’ll support a funding package for the NHS, that would see spending in Scotland rise by a total of £2 billion by 202021,",504,51902,201505
helping us to deliver the worldclass care that people in Scotland rightly expect.,504,51902,201505
"For fair pay – we’ll back an increase in the minimum wage to £8.70 by 2020,",412,51902,201505
"making a quarter of a million people in Scotland better off by up to £4,000 a year.",503,51902,201505
For hardpressed households – we will support lower energy bills for consumers by pushing for the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) to be funded through general taxation,503,51902,201505
"and tough new powers to make sure energy companies pass on lower energy prices to consumers, saving households around £100 on energy bills based on recent wholesale prices.",403,51902,201505
"For more jobs and growing businesses – we will seek seedfund capitalisation of the Scottish Business Development Bank, enabling new investment in Scottish business growth and innovation,",402,51902,201505
helping create thousands of new jobs,701,51902,201505
"For people approaching retirement – we’ll seek a review of the planned increase in the retirement age from 66 to 67, so that people in Scotland, who have paid in to a state pension all their lives, don’t lose out.",504,51902,201505
"For people moving into work – we’ll vote for an increase in the work allowance by 20 per cent, which means people moving in to work from benefits will keep more of their income.",701,51902,201505
"For unpaid carers – we propose an increase in carer’s allowance to bring it in line with jobseeker’s allowance, which will see over 100,000 unpaid carers in Scotland better off by almost £600 a year.",504,51902,201505
"For pensioners – we want a singletier pension set at £160 per week, with the triplelock protection continuing.",504,51902,201505
This will guarantee that the value of the state pension is fully protected.,504,51902,201505
"For no new nuclear weapons – we continue to oppose nuclear weapons and will seek to block a new generation of nuclear weapons,",105,51902,201505
saving as much as £4 billion a year in the mid2020s.,105,51902,201505
For a greener Scotland – we will continue to support a moratorium on fracking.,501,51902,201505
For our veterans – we believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and we will work to ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.,104,51902,201505
"For our cities – we believe that City Deals should be made available to all Scotland’s cities, in addition to Glasgow, bringing substantial new investment to places that are key drivers of growth in Scotland.",410,51902,201505
"For our farming community – we will look to secure a fair share of the UK’s CAP convergence uplift, which comes to the UK as a result of Scotland’s low hectare rates.",703,51902,201505
For workers in the oil & gas sector – we’ll keep the pressure on the UK Treasury to do all it can to protect jobs,701,51902,201505
and investment in the oil and gas industry in light of lower global oil prices,402,51902,201505
and will work to increase internationalisation opportunities for Scotland’s oil and gas industry,402,51902,201505
For a fairer Scotland – we’ll prioritise the immediate scrapping of the Bedroom Tax and a halt to the roll out of Universal Credit and PIP.,503,51902,201505
We’ll seek to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance by PIP and oppose the £3 billion cut in disability funding.,504,51902,201505
"In addition, we will seek an urgent reform of the conditionality and sanctions regime, to establish a fairer approach.",503,51902,201505
"For Scotland’s creative sector – we’ll seek increased investment through BBC Scotland so that a fairer share of the licence fee is spent in Scotland, giving a £100 million boost to our creative sector.",502,51902,201505

We'll also support the abolition of VAT on sanitary products.,503,51902,201505
"For young Scots – we’ll deliver 30,000 Modern Apprenticeships each year",411,51902,201505
and continue to keep university education free.,506,51902,201505
We will also back an increase in the minimum wage rate for 18 to 21 year olds to £6.86 by 2020 and believe the same rate should be paid to apprentices.,412,51902,201505
We will also support an increase in the rate for 16 to 18 year olds to £5.07.,412,51902,201505
"For our planet we will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotland’s ambitious commitments to carbon reduction.",501,51902,201505
For future generations – we should have greater financial security in the years ahead and so will call for a share of future revenues from our natural energy resources to be saved in an energy fund.,501,51902,201505
"For lowincome households – we’ll back an increase of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits, such as child benefit, universal credit and disability benefits, and also in tax credits.",503,51902,201505
For an end to Tory rule – if there are more antiTory MPs than Tory MPs in the House of Commons the only way the Conservatives get back in to government is if the Labour party let them.,305,51902,201505
The SNP will work with others to lock the Tories out of government.,305,51902,201505
"For safer communities – we’ll continue to deliver 1,000 extra police officers, a policy that has helped deliver record low crime levels in our communities.",605,51902,201505
We’ll also press for the revenue from court fines to be retained in Scotland,301,51902,201505
"and for Police Scotland and our Fire and Rescue Service to receive the same VAT exemption as other forces, with the money reinvested in safer communities.",605,51902,201505
"For a new northern focus – we’ll back budget plans to invest more in the infrastructure of Scotland and the north of England,",411,51902,201505
"including the commissioning of high speed rail linking Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England.",411,51902,201505
"For young families – we will work towards an expansion in free nursery education, from 16 hours a week to 30 hours, saving parents just under £2,000 per child per year by the end of the next Scottish Parliament",504,51902,201505
and giving thousands of young Scots a better start in life.,503,51902,201505
"For more homes – we will back plans for an annual UK target of 100,000 affordable homes and use additional capital investment to deliver a further expansion of housebuilding in Scotland, including affordable homes for purchase or rent.",503,51902,201505
For small businesses – we will press the UK government to introduce effective legal protections to ensure small businesses are paid on time.,403,51902,201505
"This election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to deliver real change, here and across the UK.",602,51902,201505
"At this election with every SNP seat, comes more power for Scotland.",301,51902,201505
"More power to pursue a real alternative to unfair cuts, an end to the Bedroom Tax,",503,51902,201505
a higher minimum wage,412,51902,201505
and protection for our NHS and valued public services.,504,51902,201505
We will invest in our economy to create more and better paid jobs.,409,51902,201505
And we will oppose a new generation of nuclear weapons.,105,51902,201505
And we will stand up for Scotland's best interests.,301,51902,201505
We always do.,301,51902,201505
That’s why SNP MPs will vote against any measure at Westminster that affects Scotland's interests or has the effect of reducing Scotland’s funding.,301,51902,201505
We believe in independence but that is not what this election is about.,602,51902,201505
A vote for the SNP is a vote to rebalance the economic and political priorities of the UK.,301,51902,201505
"It is a vote for new, better and more progressive politics for everyone.",301,51902,201505
It is a vote to make Scotland's voice heard.,602,51902,201505
Throughout this Parliament SNP MPs have worked hard to take forward the priorities of people in Scotland.,602,51902,201505
"We’ve voted: against Tory plans, backed by Labour in January of this year, for an extra £30 billion of spending cuts.",409,51902,201505
A vote for the SNP in this election is the strongest possible vote against Westminster’s austerity agenda,409,51902,201505
"to block the replacement of Trident, which would save as much as £100 billion over its lifetime,",105,51902,201505
money that we believe should be used for our health service,504,51902,201505
and to educate Scotland’s children,506,51902,201505
against the abolition of the top rate of tax,503,51902,201505
against the privatisation of the Royal Mail,413,51902,201505
"and to protect people from drilling under their homes without their permission, by opposing the Infrastructure Bill, and backing a moratorium on fracking.",416,51902,201505
"With enough SNP MPs in the House of Commons, we can end the current austerity agenda and release new investment in jobs and growth, in strengthening our society and in protecting vital public services",409,51902,201505
SNP MPs will oppose austerity and never do a deal with the Tories.,409,51902,201505
"If there is an antiTory majority of MPs, we will vote to lock out the Tories from government.",305,51902,201505
And we will make sure any Labour government can’t forget Scotland.,602,51902,201505
"Quite simply, Scotland can get better government and real influence by voting for the SNP in May.",301,51902,201505
The starting point for the next parliament and government must be an approach to the public finances that works.,414,51902,201505
"There can be no doubt, based on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s figures and the targets set by the current government itself, that George Osborne’s approach has failed on multiple counts, with borrowing rising substantially.",414,51902,201505
"Indeed, net borrowing in this financial year has exceeded the June 2010 forecast by around £50 billion.",414,51902,201505
"This is due, in large part, to a crucial weakness in the economic recovery, in particular lower than anticipated tax revenues in an economy that has become low wage and low reward for too many.",414,51902,201505
"At the same time, taxes have been cut for those at the very top of the income scale.",414,51902,201505
It is clear that a different way of doing things is needed one that places greater emphasis on economic growth,410,51902,201505
"and social solidarity,",503,51902,201505
with a realistic target to reduce government debt to a prudent level,414,51902,201505
and to maintain a balanced budget on average over the medium term.,414,51902,201505
We need a proper fiscal framework based on proven principles that have been successfully implemented elsewhere.,414,51902,201505
This includes a commitment to reduce overall government debt and move to a position of operating budget surpluses over the medium term.,414,51902,201505
"In addition, we believe fiscally responsible governments should establish a financial buffer against unforeseen future events.",414,51902,201505
"We reject the current trajectory of spending, proposed by the UK government and the limited alternative proposed by the Labour Party.",409,51902,201505
Our proposal would see public sector borrowing and public sector net debt falling in every year as a share of national income.,414,51902,201505
"In total, over £140 billion of additional public expenditure and investment would be available during the next parliament, compared to current UK government plans.",409,51902,201505
"We will also look to release additional resources by backing a series of revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, a tax on bankers' bonuses, a bank levy,   a mansion tax, a crackdown on tax avoidance, the abolition of 'non dom' status, reversal of the married couples' tax allowance, and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.",409,51902,201505
We need increased investment in economic growth,410,51902,201505
"and action to get more people into rewarding, sustainable, wellpaid employment.",701,51902,201505
"As set out above, we propose modest spending increases to invest in the economy, enabling us to deliver a stronger fiscal performance over the mediumterm.",409,51902,201505
"A stronger economy is the essential underpinning for deficit reduction in the UK, with higher levels of growth delivering increased revenues and reducing spending pressures.",409,51902,201505
"More broadly, improvements to productivity would translate into big medium and longterm improvements in the UK’s fiscal position.",409,51902,201505
We believe that this should be a central focus for government policy over the next 5 years.,404,51902,201505
The key is to both protect and promote key sectors of the Scottish economy.,404,51902,201505
The UK government has agreed to implement the key proposals put forward by the Scottish Government and the oil and gas industry.,404,51902,201505
"This is a welcome step, however, we will continue to closely monitor economic activity in the North Sea and look for a prompt and effective response from the UK government so we can maximise the economic opportunity.",404,51902,201505
"Action by the UK government was a necessary first step and will sit alongside the Scottish Government’s commitment to a new Oil and Gas Strategy, which will have a strong focus on Scotland’s oil and gas supply chain,",404,51902,201505
including ongoing skills development and opportunities for greater internationalisation of the sector.,404,51902,201505
We will also continue to push for the swift deployment of the new Oil and Gas Authority in Aberdeen.,301,51902,201505
"There are a number of additional steps we believe should be taken by the UK government, while they continue to hold the reserved responsibility, to boost Scotland’s economic performance.",404,51902,201505
This includes additional capital investment to support sustainable and broadbased economic recovery,404,51902,201505
and make the country as a whole more internationally competitive.,404,51902,201505
"Despite having limited powers, we have taken action to boost our economy and support employment.",402,51902,201505
"For example, at the height of the financial crisis, we were able to accelerate capital investment in ‘shovel ready’ projects",402,51902,201505
"and could also take forward a range of innovative financing mechanisms and get better value for money through the Scottish Futures Trust,",402,51902,201505
"meaning more money was available for frontline, job creation projects.",402,51902,201505
"In addition, our specific focus on youth employment, with guarantees on access to education and training and a massive expansion of Modern Apprenticeship places,",411,51902,201505
and our support for small businesses with an extensive rates relief package (helping many survive the worst of the crisis),402,51902,201505
have made a difference for thousands of people across Scotland.,503,51902,201505
"We’ve also made sure people have more money in their pockets, with the Council Tax frozen, real terms cuts in water bills and policies like free prescriptions providing a welcome boost for family incomes.",503,51902,201505
"Thanks to this approach, more money is available to spend in local economies.",409,51902,201505
"As a result, we have reduced unemployment, increased employment in Scotland and have a stronger record on youth employment than the UK.",701,51902,201505
"We firmly believe that additional investment in Scotland’s infrastructure, and that of the rest of the UK, is an important part of building the wider strength of our economy and society.",411,51902,201505
Our proposals for additional expenditure in the next Parliament will include substantial new infrastructure investment.,411,51902,201505
"Properly deployed, capital expenditure has the ability to reduce inequalities by providing good, well paid employment, with opportunities for the longterm unemployed, for apprenticeships and for wider skills and professional development.",503,51902,201505
"It also serves to expand the productive capacity of Scotland, making our economy more competitive, with improved connectivity and infrastructure that is fit for the 21st century.",411,51902,201505
"The additional investment we seek should include investment in our energy infrastructure so we can continue to maximise renewables generation, in particular offshore.",411,51902,201505
"Current Westminster plans put at risk the creation of a strong domestic renewables industry, including a sustainable supply chain, and threaten Scotland’s security of supply.",416,51902,201505
"We will, for example, press for further progress and a clear timescale for the delivery of the islands interconnector and reform of the transmission charging regime which could lead to the premature closure of Longannet power station.",411,51902,201505
We will also support steps to increase the capital available to the Green Investment Bank,416,51902,201505
and will ask the next UK government to report on options including new borrowing powers for the bank.,416,51902,201505
"We will also seek adequate transport infrastructure investment, with a particular aim of improving transport and communication links across the north of these isles.",411,51902,201505
"That includes connecting Scotland to HS2 as a priority, with construction beginning in Scotland as well as England,",411,51902,201505
"and a high speed connection between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as part of any highspeed rail network.",411,51902,201505
"In addition, we will seek additional investment to support a more rapid roll out of superfast broadband and 4G across Scotland",411,51902,201505
"and to support wider and affordable access to the internet in our most disadvantaged communities,",411,51902,201505
and for a Universal Service Obligation to be applied to telecoms and broadband providers ensuring everyone is able to access the communications they need.,411,51902,201505
"We will back investment a housebuilding target across the UK of 100,000 affordable homes per year.",503,51902,201505
"We are determined to use capital investment to create jobs,",701,51902,201505
and support higher levels of economic growth.,410,51902,201505
"This additional investment would support at least 6,500 jobs in the construction sector in Scotland.",701,51902,201505
"We want to make it much easier for growing businesses across Scotland to access finance and will look for an expansion of lending options, including peertopeer lending and making it easier for new entrants to the market, in particular to help with short term financing.",402,51902,201505
We believe the UK government should be doing more to rebalance economic activity on these isles,301,51902,201505
"and so we will press for seedfund capitalisation of the new Scottish Business Development Bank, enabling new finance and investment for Scottish business to maximise job creation and growth.",402,51902,201505
"We support calls for more readily available export finance and believe the steps outlined in the Scottish Government’s updated Economic Strategy, with its focus on internationalisation, will boost export opportunities for Scottish businesses and help increase the number of Scottish exporters.",402,51902,201505
We also believe that more should be done to help small businesses with cash flow and will press the UK government to introduce effective legal protections to ensure small businesses are paid on time.,402,51902,201505
We agree that small businesses should have rights within key utility markets more akin to those of household consumers.,403,51902,201505
"For our tourism sector, we will press for the early devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD) so we can use this new power to encourage more direct flights to Scotland,",402,51902,201505
with a reduction of 50 per cent and longer term plans to abolish APD completely.,402,51902,201505
"We will also support examining a reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector,",402,51902,201505
levelling the playing field with other EU nations,403,51902,201505
"and helping create as many as 10,000 new jobs.",701,51902,201505
"For our creative industries, we will press for the BBC in Scotland to receive a fairer share of licence fee revenue generated in Scotland, which would bring a £100 million boost to Scotland’s creative sector.",502,51902,201505
We support the creation of a Creative Content Fund for the games industry to encourage the formation of new studios,502,51902,201505
and also back the retention of the Video Games tax relief.,502,51902,201505
We back industry calls for an increase in the SEIS investment limit and changes to the Shortage Occupation List to recognise specific skills needs in the sector.,502,51902,201505
Scotland needs an immigration policy suited to our specific circumstances and needs.,408,51902,201505
"In particular, we wish to see the reintroduction of the poststudy work visa so students who have been educated in Scotland can spend 2 years working here after their studies and can contribute to growing our economy.",410,51902,201505
"We will examine proposals to maintain the Annual Investment Allowance at a stable rate and consider whether it can be maintained at £500,000 and whether it can be extended until the end of the next Parliament in 2020.",402,51902,201505
"This allowance supports investment in plant, machinery and premises and we believe business deserves certainty to enable them to make longerterm investment decisions.",402,51902,201505
"We will also support a phased increase in the Employment Allowance from £2,000 per business per year to £6,000 per business per year by 201920.",402,51902,201505
This will provide a boost to employment growth by reducing the cost of creating and maintaining jobs.,402,51902,201505
This proposal will particularly benefit smaller businesses with over 95% of the support going to smaller firms.,402,51902,201505
The SNP will use its influence at Westminster to deliver key economic advantages for Scotland.,301,51902,201505

Easier access to finance for growing Scottish companies through the Scottish Business Development Bank,402,51902,201505

"We believe that public sector organisations should be able to bid to operate rail services,",413,51902,201505
as allowed in EU law but currently prevented by UK legislation.,108,51902,201505
This would enable us to ensure the delivery of rail services in Scotland that deliver maximum economic and social benefit.,413,51902,201505
One of the greatest indictments of the current Westminster system is that it works best for one part of society and one part of the country.,602,51902,201505
"Social and geographic imbalances are increasing at a worrying rate, with an increasing imbalance between London, and the southeast, and the rest of the UK.",301,51902,201505
SNP MPs will seek to rebalance the UK for the benefit of people in the north and west of these isles.,301,51902,201505
"We believe that investment in so called “national” projects in London, should be subject to normal consequential funding for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland",301,51902,201505
"and that the North of England, in particular, should see a significant increase in infrastructure expenditure.",411,51902,201505
"Alongside the development of High Speed Rail from London to the Midlands,",411,51902,201505
"we will seek a commitment to deliver High Speed Rail between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as the first stage of a link connecting Scotland and the north of England to London.",411,51902,201505
High Speed Rail should be constructed both from the north down and from the south up.,411,51902,201505
"We will support Scotland’s city authorities with proposals for new City Deals – like the one already agreed with Glasgow and Clyde Valley – and will seek the creation of a £300 million Scottish Cities Fund, and similar Northern Cities and Welsh Cities funds, to ensure adequate resources are available to support the growth of major urban centres in the north and west of the UK.",301,51902,201505
"While a strong London is good for the UK, also having a strong Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Cardiff, Newcastle and Leeds is even better.",301,51902,201505
"The SNP will also aim to right a longterm economic injustice, by ensuring that a share of future oil and gas and renewable energy revenues are used to create a Sovereign Wealth Fund.",404,51902,201505
The current UK government has conceded the principle by proposing a natural resource fund for the benefit of the North of England.,404,51902,201505
The fund should be established when economic circumstances allow and should come under the ownership and management of the Scottish Parliament and Government.,404,51902,201505
"We will look to boost Scotland’s rural economy by pressing for a fair share of the UK’s CAP convergence uplift, which comes to the UK as a result of Scotland’s low hectare rates.",703,51902,201505
The Scottish Government has prioritised Scotland’s rural economy and is working to strengthen our rural and remote communities.,703,51902,201505
"This includes measures such as Road Equivalent Tariff,",703,51902,201505
a focus on the promotion of our food and drink sector,703,51902,201505
and key infrastructure investment such as the dualling of the A9.,411,51902,201505
"At Westminster, SNP MPs will seek the same level of commitment to our rural industries and communities.",703,51902,201505
"In particular, we will scrutinise UK government actions at an EU level to ensure that our farming and fishing industries receive full backing and support.",703,51902,201505
"Other measures, proposed in this manifesto, that will be of particular benefit to our rural economy and rural communities are:",703,51902,201505
"Protection of the Royal Mail’s Universal Service Obligation,",703,51902,201505
the maintenance of the 30 per cent government share of Royal Mail in order to protect the public interest,413,51902,201505

Pressing for a fair deal on fuel prices for rural areas,703,51902,201505
The full devolution of all food levies so we can support the promotion of Scotland’s food and drink,301,51902,201505
"We will firmly oppose, and seek to reverse, the growing inequality in UK society",503,51902,201505
– inequality that acts as a dampener on growth and limits opportunity for people in communities across the country.,503,51902,201505
"That is why we must create a fair wage economy,",403,51902,201505
with higher wages for those on low and middle earnings translating into increased revenues for the Exchequer.,403,51902,201505
Underpinning this is our belief that everyone should have the opportunity of a good life in return for their effort and hard work.,403,51902,201505
Increasing the minimum wage and expanding the living wage will help deliver both a strong economy and a fairer society.,403,51902,201505
"Instead of the current, failed Westminster approach, which is based on the false belief that the fruits of economic growth ‘trickle down’, we believe that increasing the incomes of those lower down the income scale will deliver a more direct benefit for our economy, as well as improving quality of life for hardpressed households.",403,51902,201505
"This alternative approach sees all our citizens as valued contributors to society,",503,51902,201505
"with the impact of higher disposable incomes felt most significantly in local economies and our thousands of small and medium sized businesses, as well as in higher revenues.",403,51902,201505
We also propose different spending and taxation priorities.,403,51902,201505
"At a time when thousands of our citizens are forced to use food banks, there can be no doubt that spending billions on a new generation of nuclear weapons is unjustifiable.",105,51902,201505
"A vote for the SNP is a vote to halt progress on Trident renewal, delivering a saving of £100 billion over the next 35 years.",105,51902,201505
"Alongside this, we will back proposals to return the top rate of income tax in the UK to 50p.",403,51902,201505
We support a levy on tobacco firms,403,51902,201505
"and would also support proposals for a specific tax on properties valued at over £2 million,",403,51902,201505
"increases to the bank levy,",403,51902,201505
a banker’s bonus tax,403,51902,201505
and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.,403,51902,201505
"We would also call on the UK government to move forward cautiously with plans to increase the higher rate threshold to £50,000, ensuring first that tax revenues are sufficiently buoyant.",403,51902,201505
"We will look to ensure the public interest is fully protected in any future disposal of RBS and Lloyds shares, including decisions on how any windfall revenues should be used.",403,51902,201505
It’s clear that action needs to be taken to ensure we have a tax system that is fit for the 21st century.,303,51902,201505
"We will back measures to tackle tax avoidance, including early legislation to address tax dodging and an increase in staff resources at HMRC.",303,51902,201505
We will put forward measures to strengthen antiavoidance law across the UK to ensure it is as strong as new Scottish legislation.,605,51902,201505
We will also support a review of controlled foreign companies exemptions,403,51902,201505
and favour a rolling review of tax reliefs as part of an ongoing programme of simplification of the tax system.,303,51902,201505
We support calls for a global fair tax summit to agree international measures to tackle tax abuses.,403,51902,201505
"Using the current powers of devolution, the SNP Scottish Government has taken forward policies designed to support households through the recession.",403,51902,201505
"For example, we have frozen the Council Tax,",403,51902,201505
removed prescription charges,504,51902,201505
"and road tolls,",403,51902,201505
"increased free nursery provision,",504,51902,201505
provided free school meals in the early years of primary school,504,51902,201505
and reintroduced free university education.,506,51902,201505
"Taken together, these measures have saved people across Scotland hundreds of pounds.",403,51902,201505
That includes pensioners saving an average £250 a year from concessionary travel or people with long term illnesses an average of £104 on prescription charges.,403,51902,201505
A vote for the SNP in May is a vote to protect these gains.,403,51902,201505
"As well as certainty on Council Tax bills, we have also placed limits on increases in rail fares and water charges.",403,51902,201505
Through tough and effective regulation of Scottish Water we’ve been able to deliver realterms cuts in water bills.,403,51902,201505
In the same way we wish to see a more robust approach to energy bills and believe Ofgem should be empowered to enforce price reductions to reflect lower wholesale costs as a result of lower oil prices.,403,51902,201505
"Consumers must see the benefit of lower wholesale costs in their bills, with savings of as much as £100 a year.",403,51902,201505
The Scottish Government and UK government should have joint oversight of Ofgem.,403,51902,201505
"We will continue to support older Scots, by retaining key policies such as the free bus pass and free personal care and we’ll back the continuation of the free TV license.",504,51902,201505
"At Westminster, we will call for the pension triple lock to be retained, ensuring the State Pension increases each year in line with inflation, wages or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is higher.",504,51902,201505
"And, we will support for a Single Tier Pension rate of £160 per week.",504,51902,201505
We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit – introduced to reward people for saving for their pension.,504,51902,201505
We believe that there should be a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.,504,51902,201505
"And, given Scotland’s colder climate, we will also resist any attempts to end the winter fuel allowance.",504,51902,201505
"We will continue to support the roll out of auto enrolment for occupational pensions and also back, in principle, proposals to give pensioners more flexibility over their pension pots.",504,51902,201505
"However, we must ensure adequate levels of advice and support.",504,51902,201505
"We will work with pensioner groups to identify and target unfair, hidden pension charges.",504,51902,201505
Westminster has presided over a relentless undermining of our social security system.,504,51902,201505
The SNP is determined to target the worst and most damaging welfare changes introduced by the current government,504,51902,201505
"and to address issues such as zerohour contracts, which create unacceptable levels of uncertainty and financial insecurity for often low paid workers.",403,51902,201505
"We will support efforts in the next parliament to end unfair and exploitative zerohour contracts,",403,51902,201505
"with a timelimited consultation, which fully involves businesses and the trade unions, to agree the most effective way forward.",405,51902,201505
SNP MPs will vote for the complete abolition of the bedroom tax.,504,51902,201505
This will mean that the £35 million that the Scottish Government spends on mitigating its impact will be available for other purposes.,504,51902,201505
We would invest that money to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.,504,51902,201505
We also back increases of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits and believe the roll out of both Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit should be halted.,504,51902,201505
We will aim to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance with PIP.,504,51902,201505
We will also oppose the £3 billion cut in disability support.,504,51902,201505
"In addition, we have given assurances to people already supported by the Independent Living Fund that support will continue.",504,51902,201505
We will also support an urgent review of the system of assessments for disability benefits.,504,51902,201505
"The current tapers for Universal Credit have been set too low, which means claimants will still be caught in the benefits trap, with clear financial disincentives in place for work.",504,51902,201505
"We believe there should be an increase in the work allowance, to deliver a significant boost to the incomes of people moving into work, helping to lift them and their families out of poverty.",504,51902,201505
We will also support an overhaul of the Work Capability Assessments.,504,51902,201505
"These are still delivering too many poor decisions, which are overturned on appeal, creating real hardship for households.",504,51902,201505
"We will demand an urgent review of the conditionality and sanctions regime, in order to deliver an overhaul of the current, deeply ineffective arrangements, which impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society.",504,51902,201505
The review will take particular account of the needs of people with mental health issues.,504,51902,201505
"We will seek to establish an approach that is proportionate and ethical, that recognises the particular challenges facing some individuals, and that avoids excessive or blanket measures which penalise those looking for work.",504,51902,201505
"The removal of cash benefits should be a last, rather than a first, resort.",504,51902,201505
We will support an increase in Carers' Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.,504,51902,201505
Those in receipt of Carers' Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.,504,51902,201505
"We will also press for the introduction, in Scotland, of a pilot programme of carer’s leave.",504,51902,201505
"We will not support attempts to restrict housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds and believe exemptions to the Shared Accommodation Rate should be extended, for example, to cover all ages.",504,51902,201505
We believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and so will ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.,504,51902,201505
Ending fuel poverty has also been a key campaign for the SNP at Westminster for decades.,403,51902,201505
"In this next Parliament, we will seek action to ensure that those using prepayment meters have access to the same lower energy prices available to those using other payment methods.",403,51902,201505
"We will also press the UK government to ensure that pensioners whose homes are ‘off grid’ receive their winter fuel allowances earlier, so they can take advantage of lower prices earlier in the year.",504,51902,201505
This election is an opportunity for Scotland to have real influence to deliver important gains and protections.,301,51902,201505
"On a wide range of issues, Scottish values and priorities can carry real weight at Westminster.",602,51902,201505
"We will press the UK government to work with the business community on mechanisms to formalise the relationship between government, employer associations and employee associations with a particular focus on encouraging wider trade union participation and recognising the positive role that can be played by collective bargaining in improving labour market conditions.",405,51902,201505
Evidence from the OECD shows that stronger trade unions tend to reduce inequality in labour income and ensure a more equal distribution of earnings.,405,51902,201505
"We support increased employee representation on company boards, believing that this can help bolster longterm decisionmaking and improve industrial relations.",405,51902,201505
We will urge the UK government to consult on how best to deliver such an increase.,405,51902,201505
"We will seek to reverse recent changes, which reduced key aspects of workers’ rights.",405,51902,201505
"For example, we will press for the restoration of a 90 days consultation period for redundancies affecting 100 or more employees.",405,51902,201505
"In addition, we will also oppose Tory plans to further restrict the right to strike",405,51902,201505
"and support trade unions with their proposals to modernise the way strike ballots are undertaken, with safe and secure online voting to maximise participation.",405,51902,201505
"We will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotland’s ambitious commitments to carbon reduction",501,51902,201505
and that both Scotland and the UK are able to play a constructive role at this year’s UN Climate Change Conference.,501,51902,201505
"And, we will call on the UK government to match the approach of the Scottish Government with a dedicated Climate Justice Fund.",501,51902,201505
"We will seek to maximise support for offshore wind, including by seeking alterations to the current Contracts for Differences (CFD) regime to ensure that support is given to the offshore wind sector to not only generate renewable energy",501,51902,201505
but also to boost manufacturing opportunities and ensure Scotland sees maximum investment.,501,51902,201505
Allocations from the next round of CFD should be made early and projects in Scotland should be prioritised and receive their fair share of funding.,501,51902,201505
We want to see a longterm commitment to the development of this industry.,501,51902,201505
"We will continue to argue for changes to ensure that Scottish renewables, and Scotland’s islands, are not penalised because of their distance from markets in the south of England.",501,51902,201505
"We believe that transmission arrangements should work to support, rather than undermine, production of renewable energy in the most favourable locations.",501,51902,201505
And we will press for onshore wind to continue to receive support through the lifetime of the next Parliament.,501,51902,201505
Our ambition is not limited to wind.,501,51902,201505
We want the UK government to remove barriers that are limiting growth in the hydro sector,501,51902,201505
and believe there should be additional support for pump hydro and Carbon Capture and Storage schemes.,501,51902,201505
We also wish to see a big expansion in community heating schemes and believe the Renewable Heat Incentive should continue beyond 2015.,501,51902,201505
The Scottish Government has ambitious targets to support community energy generation and we will press the UK government to make it simpler for communities to establish local energy companies and easier for community schemes to access the grid.,403,51902,201505
"While responsibility for animal welfare is devolved to the Scottish Parliament –and the SNP in government is already working to improve the conditions of kept animals, including consultations on responsible dog ownership",501,51902,201505
"and wild animals in travelling circuses,",501,51902,201505
"and giving consideration to further protection at slaughter,",501,51902,201505
the registration or licensing of horse establishments,501,51902,201505
and a review of tail docking in working dogs at Westminster,501,51902,201505
we will support further animal welfare measures with a global focus.,501,51902,201505
This includes action to end the illegal ivory trade and protect species such as polar bears and bluefin tuna.,501,51902,201505
Scotland is an outward looking nation.,602,51902,201505
"We have family in all parts of the world and our society has been strengthened, over generations, by new Scots arriving from across the globe.",602,51902,201505
"This is part of who we are and provides untold benefits, socially, culturally and economically.",602,51902,201505
That is why we must do all we can to prevent increasingly insular attitudes at Westminster from shutting Scotland off from the world.,602,51902,201505
"Backing the Scottish Government’s international strategy The Scottish Government’s international strategy is based on three core elements participation, promotion and protection and these will be central to our approach at Westminster.",107,51902,201505
"We expect the UK government to participate fully in international institutions, to respect their role and to work with them.",107,51902,201505
This includes the UK fulfilling all its international obligations.,107,51902,201505
The UK’s standing in the world has been damaged by our involvement in the illegal war in Iraq.,105,51902,201505
"We wish to see proper oversight and approval for any future UK military action, which would need to be in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and approved by Parliament.",105,51902,201505
We will call on the next UK government to pursue a two state solution for Israel and Palestine and to support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state.,106,51902,201505
"The European Union is far from perfect, however we believe that it is overwhelmingly in Scotland’s interests for us to remain a member,",108,51902,201505
"engaging with the institutions as fully as we can, and to argue for reform from within.",108,51902,201505
"We will oppose UK withdrawal from the EU and will propose that, in any future referendum there should be a double majority requirement.",108,51902,201505
Each of the four constituent nations of the UK would have to vote for withdrawal before the UK as a whole could leave the European Union.,108,51902,201505
"We believe there should be a greater role for devolved administrations in the Council of Ministers and more direct engagement in devolved policy areas, across the full range of European institutions.",108,51902,201505
"We will seek a Cooperation Agreement between the UK government and devolved administrations, which will include formal agreement on speaking rights for Scottish ministers and direct Scottish input into the development of UK policy on key EU issues.",108,51902,201505
We support free movement within the EU and recognise both the contribution EU citizens make to Scottish society and the opportunities created for Scottish citizens elsewhere in the EU.,108,51902,201505

"We will also seek an explicit exemption for the NHS and Scottish Water, as part of a general public sector exemption, from the terms of the proposed TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.",110,51902,201505
"Today, Scottish international aid investment is making a big difference to thousands of lives in some of the world’s most disadvantaged communities.",107,51902,201505
We have long supported the United Nations target to spend 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI) on international development and will continue to support UK spending at this level,107,51902,201505
"– which must be calculated on current, not former, measurements of GNI.",107,51902,201505
"As part of a commitment to focus on aid quality, we believe that overseas aid funding should not be used for defence related expenditure",105,51902,201505
and should not undermine public services in developing countries.,107,51902,201505
"And, we are in favour of an audit of outstanding debt owed by developing countries, with debt relief provided as appropriate.",107,51902,201505

including continued engagement with the Scottish Government.,301,51902,201505
"The SDSR must review the current Ministry of Defence record, which includes falsely inflating spending commitments, mismanaging Army personnel reforms and creating dangerous capability gaps.",104,51902,201505
"In particular, we believe there should be ocean going conventional patrol vessels based permanently in Scotland",104,51902,201505
and will seek the early procurement of multirole Maritime Patrol Aircraft purchased ‘off the shelf’ by the end of this parliament and operating from Scotland.,104,51902,201505
The SDSR must also fully consider the advantages of a defence policy without weapons of mass destruction and wasting £100bn renewing Trident.,105,51902,201505
We will continue in our principled opposition to nuclear weapons and believe that the UK should abandon plans to renew the Trident nuclear missile system.,105,51902,201505
"In addition, the MoD should also publish in full current and projected annual costs of the Trident system and its proposed successor programme, including nuclear weapons throughlife costs.",105,51902,201505
"UK policy has seen reductions in conventional footprint in Scotland, leading to a significant underspend, meaning fewer jobs and less defence related spending to benefit local economies.",104,51902,201505
Existing conventional bases in Scotland should be retained and all conventional rebasing activities should be completed by the end of this parliament.,104,51902,201505
There should be no further erosion of the Scottish regiments,104,51902,201505
and it remains our ambition to see the traditional regiments restored.,104,51902,201505
"We support greater transparency in UK defence spending, with a full breakdown of spending by nation and region in the UK, including all procurement and SME expenditure and a full breakdown of component costs of all major projects by location.",104,51902,201505
With taxpayers in Scotland contributing billions of pounds more than the MOD currently spends in Scotland we believe that a far larger proportion of the defence procurement budget should be spent in Scotland.,104,51902,201505
There should be a strategy developed by the MOD to ensure more small and medium sized enterprises in Scotland are part of the manufacturing support chain for major defence projects.,104,51902,201505
The Type 26 frigates must be built in Scotland and the Aircraft Carriers refitted at Rosyth.,104,51902,201505
"The duty of care to our service personnel, veterans and their families must be a key priority.",104,51902,201505
The MoD should provide much better support to next of kin and bereaved families in the event of a loss of a serving relative.,104,51902,201505
"As a matter of safety, we believe a collision warning system should be installed on Tornado and Typhoon aircraft as quickly as possible.",104,51902,201505
We also support giving Armed Forces representative bodies a statutory footing.,104,51902,201505
There is no doubt that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals cause harm and hardship in communities across Scotland.,503,51902,201505
"That’s why the Scottish Government needs legislative powers to control the growth and impact of these machines,",403,51902,201505
and we believe the UK government should devolve these powers in full.,301,51902,201505
The problem of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals is linked to the proliferation of betting shops in some communities and so we will continue to argue for Scotland to have full responsibility for the regulation of gambling.,403,51902,201505
"We will also seek new powers so we can effectively regulate payday lenders in Scotland’s communities, building on the recommendations of the Smith Commission and going beyond proposals set out so far by the current UK government.",403,51902,201505
"We do not support Tory plans for the reintroduction of the so called ‘snoopers’ charter’, which would see all online activity of every person in the UK stored for a year.",605,51902,201505
"Instead, we need a proportionate response to extremism.",605,51902,201505
"That is why we will support targeted, and properly overseen, measures to identify suspected extremists and, if necessary, examine their online activity and communications.",605,51902,201505
"We believe that responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland should transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament and we will support moves to more devolved arrangements for the BBC with greater powers and funding for the different national and regional broadcasting areas, such as BBC Scotland.",301,51902,201505
"We believe that the licence fee should be retained with any replacement system,",502,51902,201505
"which should be based primarily on the ability to pay, in place by the end of the next BBC Charter period.",503,51902,201505
"BBC Scotland should receive a fairer share of BBC income, reflecting more accurately the licence fee revenue raised here in Scotland.",301,51902,201505
"This would provide a boost of over £100 million, which we believe will provide important new opportunities for production companies and the creative sector in Scotland.",502,51902,201505
The Scottish Government and Parliament should have a substantial role at all stages in the review of the BBC Charter and we will work to ensure that any new governance arrangements for the BBC better reflect Scotland’s interests.,301,51902,201505
It should also be for the Scottish Government to decide which sporting events in Scotland should be included in the list of those that are free to view in Scotland.,502,51902,201505
Regulation of print media is already devolved.,301,51902,201505
"The Scottish Parliament chose, on a cross party basis, to support the UK Government’s actions to implement Leveson.",301,51902,201505
"We will consider carefully the results of the first year review and work with other parties, in Scotland and at Westminster, to ensure effective regulation of the media on a nonpolitical basis.",301,51902,201505
We will press the UK government to reinstate an emergency towing vehicle on the west coast of Scotland and to ensure that delays in recruitment don’t leave vital coastguard stations understaffed.,301,51902,201505
"We will seek a commitment for the earliest possible return of the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre to Kinloss, so that search and rescue operations can be coordinated in Scotland.",301,51902,201505
This election gives us a rare opportunity to begin to repair what is an increasingly broken political system in the UK.,202,51902,201505
We need to make clear to those who wield power that they do so only with the consent of the people.,202,51902,201505
Almost every aspect of the system needs an overhaul.,202,51902,201505
That includes an effective power of recall for MPs.,202,51902,201505
"We will continue to work with others, across the political parties, to deliver a system that gives real power to voters to remove MPs who have forfeited the trust of their electors.",202,51902,201505
We also badly need a fair voting system for UK elections.,202,51902,201505
"The electoral system means political focus is on the interests of a small number of swing voters in marginal seats, and that has meant the economic and social needs of areas like the north of England, Scotland, the West Midlands and Wales have been forgotten.",202,51902,201505
"The SNP supports the Single Transferable Vote, a system that makes sure every vote and every part of the country counts.",202,51902,201505
"Of course, the second chamber of the UK parliament is not even elected and continues to have hereditary members who have a greater say in the future of Scotland’s defence or welfare system than the elected members of the Scottish Parliament.",204,51902,201505
The SNP believes the House of Lords should be scrapped and replaced with a fully elected second chamber.,204,51902,201505
Given the successful inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds in the independence vote the Scottish Parliament is legislating to ensure they also have the vote in Holyrood elections.,202,51902,201505
We believe 16 and 17 year olds should be given the vote in UK general and European elections and will work with future governments to secure this change,202,51902,201505
We  support  strict  rules  on  lobbying  but  believe  that campaigning  charities  should  be  allowed  straightforward  access  and  restrictions  on  their  activities  as ‘nonparty  campaigners’  should  be  removed.,202,51902,201505
"Scotland’s new First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, has given a very clear signal of the need to have more equal representation of men and women in public life.",202,51902,201505
The Scottish Cabinet is one of only three cabinets in the developed world to have an equal number of men and women,202,51902,201505
"and, with the necessary powers devolved, we will take forward proposals to ensure 50 per cent female representation on public boards.",202,51902,201505
We will press for the same step to be taken for UK wide public bodies and will also encourage the new UK government to work with the private sector to increase the number of women represented at the most senior levels in our major companies.,202,51902,201505
"We will support the tightening of the law on maternity discrimination, with legislation introduced within the first year of a new UK government.",201,51902,201505
We have also called for early action on Equal Pay audits for larger companies to ensure women are getting the salaries they are entitled to.,201,51902,201505
"We will demand that section 78 of the Equalities Act 2010 is commenced and that regulations to compel employers of more than 250 people to publish annual gender pay gap information, starting in 201617, are consulted on and brought into law.",201,51902,201505
"We are determined to ensure a fairer deal for women, not only in the work place.",503,51902,201505
That’s why we’ll address a longstanding failure in our tax system by demanding that VAT on sanitary products is removed.,503,51902,201505
"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a luxury, and should not be taxed.",503,51902,201505
"With powers over equalities devolved, we would bring forward an Equal Pay (Scotland) Bill to finally deliver equal pay law that works for women in Scotland.",201,51902,201505
It is unacceptable 45 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970 that the gender pay gap remains.,201,51902,201505
"This would include consultation on how new regulations or structures can be created by the Bill to expedite the equal pay claims process, and ensure that settlements are enforced quickly.",201,51902,201505
We will seek to maintain the protections provided by the Equality Act 2010 and will ask the government to engage with key stakeholders on potential improvements.,201,51902,201505
We will also support calls to establish a Race Committee to advise the work of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.,201,51902,201505
"In addition, we will ask the UK government to conduct an early review of the current immigration detention system and regime, in order to deliver a fairer and more effective system as we move forward.",201,51902,201505
"Given the central place of human rights in Scotland’s constitutional settlement, and their importance at the heart of our politics, we will oppose scrapping the Human Rights Act",201,51902,201505
or withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights.,108,51902,201505
"Too often in recent years, decisions by governments at Westminster have undermined the ability of the Scottish Government to deliver as much as it would wish.",301,51902,201505
"This has included budget cuts as a result of austerity, questionable application of the Barnett Formula and long delays in giving approval for Scottish Government proposals, for example the mechanism to mitigate the Bedroom Tax in Scotland.",301,51902,201505
A strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster can do more to ensure that the UK government is not standing in the way of progress for Scotland.,301,51902,201505
"At the heart of this manifesto is our commitment to move away from the damaging austerity agenda of the current UK government, so that we can protect Scotland’s public services from future Tory cuts and protect the progress that has been delivered by tens of thousands of dedicated public sector staff.",301,51902,201505
"In health, with the SNP, the number of staff working in Scotland’s NHS has risen to a record high, with over 10,000 more people now working in the NHS.",504,51902,201505
"These staff have delivered shorter waiting times, including in vitally important areas such as cancer treatment.",504,51902,201505
"While there is still work to do, the number of people starting treatment for cancer within 62 days of referral has risen from 84.5 per cent in 2007 to 94.2 per cent.",504,51902,201505
"Nearly twothirds of people in Scotland now say they are satisfied with our health service, according to the most recent survey, compared to just twofifths in 2005.",504,51902,201505
"In our schools, against every main measure, education is getting better.",506,51902,201505
"We have record exam results and record high number of school leavers in either work, training or further or higher education.",506,51902,201505
The number of P1 pupils in Scotland taught in classes of more than 25 has fallen to just 451 this year,506,51902,201505
"– 97 per cent lower than the 16,845 children recorded in 2006.",506,51902,201505
"And the proportion of schools reported as being in ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ condition has increased again, to 83 per cent – up from 61 per cent in April 2007.",506,51902,201505
That means the number of pupils in poor or bad buildings has more than halved since 2007.,506,51902,201505
"Since the election of the SNP government in 2007: There has been an increase of over 2,300 nurses and midwives in Scotland and 2,350 doctors",504,51902,201505
More than 320 extra GPs work in our communities,504,51902,201505
"and there are almost 1,350 more consultants providing specialist care in our NHS,",504,51902,201505
including a 170 per cent increase in A&E consultants,504,51902,201505
We’ve seen an 8.8 per cent increase in the number of paramedics,504,51902,201505
while the number of senior managers in the NHS is down 29 per cent.,504,51902,201505
We’ve  protected  NHS  spending  against Westminster  austerity  –  and  we  will  argue  for increases  in  health  spending  across  the  UK  of £9.5  billion  above  inflation  by  202021   £24 billion  in  total.,504,51902,201505
This  will  deliver  a  total  increase for  NHS  Scotland  of  £2  billion  by  202021.,504,51902,201505
And in our communities people are feeling safer.,605,51902,201505
The crime clear up rate is the highest since comparable records began in 1976 and recorded crime has fallen for the seventh year in a row and is now at its lowest level for 40 years.,605,51902,201505
We’ve also acted to tackle the scourge of knife crime.,605,51902,201505
The average prison sentence for handling an offensive weapon in Scotland is now three times higher than in 200405.,605,51902,201505

"Pass rates for Higher exams have reached record levels, with children sitting the new National exams for the first time last year.",506,51902,201505
And we’ve launched a £100 million Attainment Scotland Fund to support primary school pupils in some of our most disadvantaged areas,506,51902,201505
"There are 25,000 apprenticeships available every year – and we have pledged to increase this to 30,000 by 2020.",411,51902,201505
"The biggest threat to this progress is another swathe of Westminster inspired austerity cuts, which could have a devastating impact on services across the country.",403,51902,201505
Over half of the total planned cuts are still to come over the course of the next UK Parliament.,403,51902,201505
"If we don’t act now to end Tory austerity, Scotland’s cumulative share of the proposed realterms cuts over the next five years is estimated at around £12 billion £2300 for every person in Scotland.",403,51902,201505
"That is why this election is so important, so we can choose a different path forward, which enables the SNP Scottish",403,51902,201505
"We’ve rejected the approach adopted elsewhere in the UK and chosen to maintain investment in 1,000 extra police, enabling Police Scotland to deliver record low crime rates:",605,51902,201505
"Recorded crime in Scotland is at its lowest level in 40 years, and the number of homicides has halved since 2007.",605,51902,201505

with the money reinvested in safer communities.,605,51902,201505
Government to continue to deliver the high quality services people in Scotland expect.,605,51902,201505
And it is a path that will enable us to build on the continuing economic recovery.,408,51902,201505
"Over the past 12 months around 46,000 more people are in work.",701,51902,201505
"That includes, in recent months, a record high number of women in employment in Scotland.",503,51902,201505

This includes narrowing the economic gap between the different regions of Scotland.,403,51902,201505
"We are focused on four key themes – Investment, Innovation, Inclusive Growth and Internationalisation.",404,51902,201505
"We know that building a highskill, connected Scotland is essential if we are to maximise our nation’s economic potential.",404,51902,201505

"We will continue to work on promoting local food supply, including within the public sector.",403,51902,201505
"We will seek full devolved responsibility over all food levies to support the promotion of food and drink,",301,51902,201505

"and employing around 14,300 people.",703,51902,201505
"The SNP is working hard to increase revenues and profitability for the industry, with the deal secured at last December’s fisheries council adding around £10 million to the value of Scotland's whitefish and prawn stocks.",703,51902,201505
We are engaging with the industry on our review of fish quota management.,406,51902,201505
"We want to ensure quotas are managed in the common interest,",406,51902,201505
"so that active fishermen have access to the quota that they need, rather than seeing them concentrated in the hands of those with the deepest pockets.",406,51902,201505
We want to sustain jobs and find ways to support the entry of the next generation of skippers.,406,51902,201505
We will continue to work to ensure the discard ban is implemented in a way that does not damage the viability of the fleet and is workable for our fishermen.,403,51902,201505
Sensible implementation will deliver benefits for the fleet and consumers as we end the practice of dumping perfectly good fish back into the sea.,403,51902,201505
"Our aim is to grow and strengthen local economies, both urban and rural.",403,51902,201505
"By increasing the minimum wage and supporting a fair wage economy we can increase the disposable income of low and middle income households,",503,51902,201505
"which will provide a direct boost to local businesses, enabling them to grow.",403,51902,201505
"We are keen to see spending increase, and profits remain, within local communities so that more money is being circulated locally, generating jobs and opportunities for the benefit of all.",403,51902,201505

and are also providing funding of £1.5 million to increase free provision of WiFi in public buildings.,411,51902,201505

including tackling the digital divide.,411,51902,201505
"That is why we are investing in Superfast Broadband, so that at least 95 per cent of premises across Scotland will be able to access fibre broadband by the end of 2017.",411,51902,201505
From the very first days of the SNP in government in Scotland we have been determined to make our streets safer and to give people greater confidence and security in their communities and in their homes.,605,51902,201505
"That’s why we invested in 1,000 extra police and why we are committed to retaining these extra police in our communities.",605,51902,201505
"With record low crime rates and big improvements in detection, we know this is a policy that is working.",605,51902,201505
SNP MPs will join SNP ministers in pressing for all court fines income to be retained in Scotland so we can boost investment in crime reduction measures nationwide.,605,51902,201505
"We will also press for Police Scotland to have the same ability to save on VAT as other police forces across the UK, enabling Scotland’s police service to invest £23 million more in frontline services.",605,51902,201505
The same VAT exemption should also apply to Scotland’s Fire and Rescue Service.,301,51902,201505
The SNP believes that decisions about Scotland’s future – about our economy and society – are best taken by the people of Scotland:,301,51902,201505
the more powers we have in Scotland the more we can achieve for the people who live here.,301,51902,201505
That is why we campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and voted for the Scotland Act 1998.,301,51902,201505
"It is why we supported the limited extension of devolution in the Scotland Act 2012, and called for a far more substantial package of powers at that point.",301,51902,201505
The same principle underpins our continued support for independence and was at the heart of our campaign for a Yes vote in September 2014.,301,51902,201505
"During the referendum, the parties campaigning for a No vote promised the people of Scotland substantial new powers for our parliament,",301,51902,201505
"amounting to real Home Rule, maximum devolution and as close to federalism as was possible.",301,51902,201505
"It is our intention to hold them to that promise and the more SNP MPs elected in May, the greater our ability to deliver the strong package of effective devolution that people in Scotland want and need to build a fairer and more prosperous country.",301,51902,201505
"We welcome the proposals set out in the Smith Commission, as far as they go.",301,51902,201505
"The further watering down of the agreed proposals, by the UK government, is unacceptable.",301,51902,201505
"There should be no effective veto for UK ministers on the exercise of the various new powers,",301,51902,201505
in particular over the welfare system.,504,51902,201505
"We share the view of many organisations across Scotland that the package, as it stands, does not enable us to deliver fully either the greater social justice",503,51902,201505
or the powerhouse economy that our country demands.,410,51902,201505
"As the STUC has said, “there is not enough” in the Smith Commission recommendations “to empower the Scottish Parliament to tackle inequality in Scotland"".",301,51902,201505
"And, we agree with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) “that anything less than wholesale devolution of welfare would be a real missed opportunity to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in our communities”.",301,51902,201505
"The Smith Commission proposals were, in many respects, a missed opportunity.",301,51902,201505
Decisions about more than 70 per cent of Scottish taxes and 85 per cent of current UK welfare spending in Scotland will stay at Westminster.,301,51902,201505
"Instead of limited and unambitious proposals on tax powers, we should have a greater ability to generate economic growth,",410,51902,201505
deliver more employment opportunities,701,51902,201505
and support family incomes with the devolution of additional taxes.,503,51902,201505
"Instead of leaving decisions on wages and employment with Westminster, devolving these key areas to Scotland means we could ensure that people in Scotland receive fair pay for a day’s work.",701,51902,201505
"We could bring together, more effectively, skills development and employment support – enabling us to get more people into wellpaid and rewarding employment, closer to home.",701,51902,201505
"And, instead of choices on most aspects of our welfare system remaining at Westminster, the full devolution of the welfare state would give us the ability to halt the cruelest and most damaging welfare changes and instead develop a system that supports people and families in their time of need.",504,51902,201505
"It is only with the more extensive devolution of welfare, wages, taxation and the economy that we can deliver greater prosperity for more of our citizens and for Scotland as a whole.",301,51902,201505
"Our focus, therefore, will be securing specific new economic and social powers, over and above those set out in the Smith Commission proposals,",301,51902,201505
so we can tailor policy to make much more of the country’s strengths and finally address the challenges that we face as a society.,301,51902,201505
"Scotland should have the opportunity to establish its own constitutional framework, including human rights, equalities and the place of local government.",204,51902,201505
The Scottish Parliament should also have the ability to directly represent its interests on devolved matters in the EU and internationally.,301,51902,201505
"With more meaningful tax powers, we could provide more incentives and support for businesses to invest in Scotland",402,51902,201505
"and enter new markets overseas,",402,51902,201505
encouraging inward investment and boosting our international exports.,402,51902,201505
"We could also use targeted changes in business tax allowances to encourage higher levels of investment in capital or Research & Development, and encourage the growth of SMEs.",301,51902,201505
"Proper economic powers would enable a fully cohesive industrial strategy focused on strengthening manufacturing and boosting innovation, allowing us to revitalise Scotland’s industries and rebalance our economy.",410,51902,201505
Full control over social protection would allow the Scottish Parliament to tailor a new and fairer welfare system for Scotland.,504,51902,201505
"For example, no Scottish Government would have introduced the Bedroom Tax in Scotland and, looking forward, we would be able to protect people from any future ideological attacks from Westminster on the very essence of our social security system.",504,51902,201505
"Devolving employment policy would allow us to take progressive action on low pay in order to tackle poverty and inequality,",503,51902,201505
"with the power to raise the minimum wage, regardless of the political balance at Westminster",412,51902,201505
and we could more closely integrate skills and employment policy to support people in their search for rewarding work.,701,51902,201505
We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that the promises made to Scotland during the referendum are delivered.,301,51902,201505
"We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.",301,51902,201505
"However, we believe that the proposals of the Smith Commission do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.",301,51902,201505
We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.,301,51902,201505
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals and the Scotland Act 2012 have demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would require to underpin it would take a number of years to complete.",301,51902,201505
SNP MPs will work with the Scottish Government to secure the best deal for Scotland in these negotiations.,301,51902,201505
"In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,",301,51902,201505
"welfare,",504,51902,201505
"business taxes, national insurance",402,51902,201505
and equality policy,503,51902,201505
"the powers we need to create jobs,",701,51902,201505
grow revenues,410,51902,201505
and lift people out of poverty.,503,51902,201505
"As we set out in our submission to the Smith Commission, the Barnett Formula should continue to be used to determine Scotland's resources during the transition to full fiscal responsibility and for as long as the Scottish Parliament's financial powers fall short of full responsibility.",301,51902,201505
This General Election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to have real power at Westminster.,301,51902,201505
The SNP goes into this election with a clear message none of us can afford more austerity//.,409,51902,201505
"Our NHS, our economy and our children can't afford the billions of pounds of additional cuts that the Tories, Labour and Liberals have signed up to.",409,51902,201505
And none of us can afford the £100 billion they plan to spend on new nuclear weapons.,105,51902,201505
The Westminster parties have the wrong priorities.,301,51902,201505
And it will be ordinary people across the UK who will pay the price.,503,51902,201505
Unless you choose differently.,301,51902,201505
Labour alone won't be bold enough to deliver the change ordinary people need.,305,51902,201505
A big team of SNP MPs can force the pace of progressive change.,301,51902,201505
We offer an alternative.,301,51902,201505
A responsible plan for modest spending increases,409,51902,201505
"and real investment in the NHS, housing, childcare",504,51902,201505
and jobs.,701,51902,201505
An SNP vote on May 7th will be a vote to make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.,301,51902,201505
"But ours will also be a voice for a new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster for everyone.",202,51902,201505
To deliver our plan we need a strong team of DUP MPs returned to Westminster to negotiate a good deal for Northern Ireland in the event of a hung parliament.,601,51903,201505
Only a vote for the DUP will deliver our clear plan for a better Northern Ireland and a stronger United Kingdom.,601,51903,201505
We want to create a shared and united Northern Ireland,606,51903,201505
that is economically prosperous,410,51903,201505
and plays a full and active role as part of the United Kingdom.,601,51903,201505
We will use our position at Westminster to strengthen the UK,601,51903,201505
and to seek the best deal for Northern Ireland.,601,51903,201505
We will fight for the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.,601,51903,201505
Since devolution was restored to Northern Ireland in 2007 real progress has been made across a range of areas.,301,51903,201505
"Despite all of the political ups and downs, Northern Ireland is slowly but surely moving in the right direction again.",601,51903,201505
"Over these last eight years we have been working to secure Northern Ireland’s position within the UK,",601,51903,201505
"to help grow our economy,",410,51903,201505
to offer opportunity to all,503,51903,201505
and to build reconciliation and address the legacy of the past.,106,51903,201505
"This challenge has been made all the more difficult by virtue of the global economic downturn,",410,51903,201505
the reduction in public expenditure available to the Northern Ireland Executive,602,51903,201505
and the system of government we operate.,602,51903,201505
"In spite of this, things are changing for the better.",601,51903,201505
The transformation is visible wherever you look.,601,51903,201505
"Northern Ireland is now a venue not just for international investment, but for events that would not have considered coming here just a few years ago.",601,51903,201505
"We have a plan for where we want Northern Ireland to be in 2021, the hundredth anniversary of Northern Ireland’s creation.",601,51903,201505
We have been working to deliver it.,601,51903,201505
"However, the election on 7 May will give Northern Ireland the opportunity of a lifetime to transform our Province for generations.",601,51903,201505
It is highly likely that after that election no single party will have enough seats to command a majority in the House of Commons.,305,51903,201505
That means that the votes of our MPs could be crucial.,305,51903,201505
Political commentators have consistently stated that the DUP could be crucial in what looks likely to be a hung Parliament.,305,51903,201505
The DUP will use such a position to negotiate on behalf of Northern Ireland.,305,51903,201505
This document sets out some of our key priorities for discussion with the parties which could form the next government.,305,51903,201505
It also sets out what we will do to create the kind of Northern Ireland we all wish to see.,305,51903,201505
"A century ago Ulster was an economic powerhouse within the British Isles: today with the right investment, policies and dedication we have the potential to create the conditions where we can be so once again.",410,51903,201505
To do so we need help from Westminster and we need to take bold steps at home as well.,410,51903,201505
The influence that we may have after this election gives us the once in a lifetime opportunity to transform our economic fortunes for generations to come.,410,51903,201505
In doing so we are building on firm foundations that have been laid over the last few years.,410,51903,201505
In 2007 we made growing our economy the Executive’s number one priority.,410,51903,201505
The restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland has created the peace and political stability to encourage foreign direct investment at record levels.,410,51903,201505
In fact despite the worldwide economic downturn more jobs have been created in Northern Ireland over the last four years than at any time in recorded history.,410,51903,201505
Global businesses establishing in Northern Ireland are now the norm rather than the exception.,410,51903,201505
Our claimant count has been falling for over 25 months and our headline rate of unemployment is broadly in line with the UK average.,410,51903,201505
"For the first time in many years Northern Ireland is emerging from an economic downturn alongside, rather than after the rest of the UK.",410,51903,201505
After years of campaigning we managed to persuade the UK Government to allow the Assembly to set a Northern Ireland Corporation Tax Rate,402,51903,201505
and previously had secured the devolution of Air Passenger Duty for longhaul flights.,402,51903,201505
We have attracted international events to Northern Ireland from the Giro d’Italia to the Irish Open Golf and from the European MTV Awards to the World Police and Fire Games.,410,51903,201505
We have invested in our tourism infrastructure with signature projects such as Titanic Belfast,410,51903,201505
and the Giant’s Causeway Visitor Centre,410,51903,201505
"and of course Northern Ireland is now known worldwide as the home of the hit HBO television series, ‘Game of Thrones’.",410,51903,201505
With the right support we can build upon the important work that has been done in recent years to make sure that Northern Ireland once again plays its part as an economic driver,410,51903,201505
within the United Kingdom.,601,51903,201505
More satisfactory terms in relation to Corporation Tax;,402,51903,201505

Continue to make growing our economy the number one priority;,410,51903,201505

Continue to invest in our tourism infrastructure;,410,51903,201505
Bring international events to Northern Ireland;,410,51903,201505
Put Northern Ireland on the map internationally and attract visitors from abroad.,410,51903,201505
One of the most important duties of any government is to deliver high quality public services.,504,51903,201505
This task is challenging given the increasing expectations and increased demand and the reduction in public expenditure available to Northern Ireland.,504,51903,201505
"However, despite the difficulties we have sought to meet the needs of our people by prioritising our key public services,",504,51903,201505
saving money by cutting waste,303,51903,201505
and by reforming the services that we deliver.,303,51903,201505
With the reduction in public expenditure over recent years we have had to prioritise what we need most and focus on what matters most to our people.,303,51903,201505
"In spite of the £1.5 billion reduction, in real terms, in the funding we receive in Northern Ireland, over the last eight years we have made health",504,51903,201505
and education our top two priorities in terms of public expenditure.,506,51903,201505
As a result we have increases in spending on health by 33%,504,51903,201505
and education by 23% since 2007.,506,51903,201505
That has allowed us to make sure we spend the money available to us on the areas that matter most to the general public.,303,51903,201505
As part of this process we have set ambitious targets in terms of achieving savings across government departments.,303,51903,201505
As a result in the last two Assembly terms savings of over £4 billion have been achieved to free up money from important frontline services.,303,51903,201505
Those savings have been critical to ensuring we continue to deliver the best quality public services.,503,51903,201505
"Since the restoration of devolution we have also invested more in capital spending in areas such as schools, hospitals and roads than at any point in our history.",503,51903,201505
"That has meant more new schools, hospitals and roads and other key capital infrastructure.",503,51903,201505
"The Northern Ireland Executive has also undertaken a significant programme of public sector reform with major changes in education administration, the health service and in local government.",303,51903,201505
These decisions will allow more resources to be targeted on front line services and less on administration in future years.,303,51903,201505
We have played our part in making the best use of the resources that are available to us,303,51903,201505
but it is always the dedication and commitment of those who work in the public sector that ensures world class public services can be delivered.,701,51903,201505
The challenges of delivering world class public services will only increase in the years to come but with support from Westminster and the right decisions taken at home we can not only meet but exceed expectations of our people.,601,51903,201505
A budget settlement which will allow real term increases in health,504,51903,201505
and education spending over the next five years,506,51903,201505
without decimating other key public services;,503,51903,201505
Capital investment to make our schools and hospitals fit for the twenty first century;,411,51903,201505
Assistance to reform and transform our public services.,303,51903,201505

and growing the economy;,410,51903,201505

Reform the delivery of public services to ensure that they meet the needs and expectations of the public;,303,51903,201505
"Advance an ambitious egovernment agenda, seeking to deliver an increasing number of public services via digital and online channels,",411,51903,201505

Develop a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Plan with the aim of achieving a public sector fit for the challenges of the 21st Century;,303,51903,201505
Continue to construct a public sector reform architecture that enables the Northern Ireland Executive to adopt innovative solutions to public service challenges.,303,51903,201505
One of our key goals has been to ensure that everyone can benefit from the new era that Northern Ireland has now entered and no one is left behind.,503,51903,201505
That means there must be the opportunity for everyone to succeed and a fair and level playing field for all.,503,51903,201505
This approach will not only create a society based on fairness but it will maximise the interests of Northern Ireland as a whole.,503,51903,201505
We have been working to achieve the twin goals of fairness and opportunity for all in recent years through a range of measures.,503,51903,201505
Through the Stormont House Agreement we sought to deliver affordable changes to the welfare system that would protect the most vulnerable,503,51903,201505
but would also encourage people back to work.,505,51903,201505
That includes ensuring that the bedroom tax is not in operation in Northern Ireland.,503,51903,201505
In dealing with the issue of welfare reform it is vital that we keep the proper balance between enhancing the GB welfare system and the protection of frontline public services.,414,51903,201505
We have sought to keep higher education open to all by keeping student fees much lower than in England.,506,51903,201505
Through the Social Investment Fund we have worked with communities to deliver programmes tailored to meet their specific needs.,503,51903,201505
Through Delivering Social Change we have invested in measures such as additional support for children to deliver good GCSE results.,506,51903,201505
We are working on a revolutionary new Childcare system that could help transform the sector.,504,51903,201505
We have extended support for older people including through the free transport scheme.,504,51903,201505
"To encourage opportunity for all, in education we have also retained selection based on academic ability and not the ability to pay.",503,51903,201505
"In the departments for which we have responsibility we are doing everything within the law to ensure that our Armed Forces, veterans and dependants have every possible support.",104,51903,201505
We have also ensured that local household taxes in Northern Ireland are significantly lower than anywhere else in the UK,403,51903,201505
and have resisted the introduction of Water Charges.,503,51903,201505
While we have achieved much in this area we will need the help and support of Westminster to deliver on some of our key outstanding objectives.,302,51903,201505
Welfare Reform to incentivise work but also protect those most in need;,503,51903,201505
"FROM  WESTMINSTER,  WE  WANT: The removal of the bedroom tax at a national level;",504,51903,201505
A national entitlement to enhanced support for members of the Armed Forces across the United Kingdom;,503,51903,201505

"For the first time in generations, despite all of the challenges and difficulties, Northern Ireland has had almost eight years of uninterrupted devolution.",301,51903,201505
Given the history of the last fifty years this is in itself a remarkable achievement.,301,51903,201505
During this time we have overcome many problems and have put in place arrangements that have been robust and stable.,301,51903,201505
"We do not seek to do anything which will threaten the long term stability of the political institutions however, we must now make sure that it works better in delivering for the people we represent.",202,51903,201505
In seeking to create a better system of government we should remember the progress that we have made.,202,51903,201505
The St Andrews Agreement corrected some of the key flaws of the Belfast Agreement but we continue to work towards more normal politics in Northern Ireland.,202,51903,201505
As a result of these changes important decisions require Executive approval and we have a veto over all big issues.,301,51903,201505
After years of debate and dispute we negotiated appropriate arrangements which allowed Policing and Justice powers to be passed to the Assembly in 2010 on a basis which requires the Justice Minister to be able to command a cross community majority and have operated well since,301,51903,201505
For many years we have campaigned for changes to how devolution operates.,204,51903,201505
Some of these objectives were delivered as part of the talks process which concluded last Christmas.,204,51903,201505
The Stormont House Agreement made provision for a reduction in the number of MLAs which will take effect no later than 2021.,303,51903,201505
It also agreed to create arrangements for an official opposition at Stormont and better processes for the Executive.,303,51903,201505
We have agreed a reduction in the number of government departments from twelve to nine and a reordering of functions to improve the delivery of public services.,303,51903,201505
"This will also mean a fundamental change and to OFMDFM and a more strategic focus with a new name, ‘The Executive Office.’",303,51903,201505

The number of people who want to see a united Ireland in either the short or the medium term is at an all time low.,203,51903,201505
The constitutional future of Northern Ireland has been settled for generations to come.,203,51903,201505
This has been achieved by agreeing political structures in Northern Ireland that can command crosscommunity support,202,51903,201505
and by ensuring everyone can play a full part in our society and community.,202,51903,201505
"While we should never be complacent about what has been achieved,",601,51903,201505
the focus must now move to strengthen the United Kingdom as a whole,601,51903,201505
and to enhance our British identity in Northern Ireland.,601,51903,201505
"Our place as a key and integral part of the United Kingdom has been highlighted in recent years by the decision to host the G8 at Lough Erne,",601,51903,201505
the visit of Her Majesty to Stormont in 2012,601,51903,201505
and the enormous role our people continue to play in the Armed Services.,601,51903,201505
Northern Ireland plays its full part alongside Scotland and Wales in intergovernmental relations within the United Kingdom,601,51903,201505
and every aspect of our government remains linked to Westminster.,601,51903,201505
Despite the opposition of Sinn Fein the work of the National Crime Agency is also being extended to Northern Ireland.,601,51903,201505
At Westminster our MPs have been at the forefront of the campaign for a referendum on the European Union,110,51903,201505
and in defence of our Armed Forces.,104,51903,201505
"They continue to play a key and critical role in the decisions, which affect our nation as a whole.",601,51903,201505
We have built strong and solid relationships with both major Westminster parties to allow us to maximise our influence whatever the outcome of the general election.,601,51903,201505
In Northern Ireland we are working with other unionist parties to maximise unionist representation at Westminster and to deliver on the many areas of policy where we can find agreement.,601,51903,201505
"While there is much we can do in Northern Ireland, some of these issues can only be delivered with the help of Westminster.",601,51903,201505
A fair deal for all four parts of the United Kingdom to strengthen the Union;,601,51903,201505

If only all politicians could believe in Britain as UKIP does.,601,51951,201505
"If only they could share our positive vision of Britain as a proud, independent sovereign nation,",601,51951,201505
"a country respected on the world stage,",601,51951,201505
"a major player in global trade,",601,51951,201505
with influence and authority when it comes to tackling the pressing international issues of the day.,601,51951,201505
This manifesto is our blueprint for a Britain released from the shackles of the interfering EU.,110,51951,201505
This makes it markedly different to those of the other main parties.,110,51951,201505
"While we see a free, prosperous, healthy, international future for Britain, their cowardice binds our country to a failing super-state that tells us what to do and does not listen to what we want.",110,51951,201505
"Our manifesto also throws down the gauntlet to those who have ridiculed us, jeered at us and lied about our voters, our people and our policies.",305,51951,201505
It tells the truth about what UKIP stands for.,305,51951,201505
It takes care of Britain’s finances too.,408,51951,201505
"Taxpayers could get so much better value for their money if we left the EU,",110,51951,201505
"made reasonable cuts to the foreign aid budget,",109,51951,201505
"replaced the unfair Barnett formula,",404,51951,201505
"scrapped HS2,",404,51951,201505
ended ‘health tourism’,404,51951,201505
and cut the cost of government.,303,51951,201505
These are our plans and they give us a budget to invest in Britain the other parties can only dream of.,404,51951,201505
"Without adding a penny to our burgeoning national debt, without cutting vital services and without raising taxes, we can, over the course of the next parliament:",404,51951,201505
Invest an extra £12 billion into the NHS;,504,51951,201505
put £5.2 billion more into social care;,504,51951,201505

abolish the ‘bedroom tax’,503,51951,201505
and increase the transferable personal tax allowance for married couples and civil partners,503,51951,201505
"Fund 6,000 additional posts spread between the police service, the prison service and the Border Agency",605,51951,201505
Cut business rates for small businesses,402,51951,201505

Increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP to honour our NATO obligations,104,51951,201505
Invest £1.5 billion into mental health and dementia services,504,51951,201505
Pay carers an extra £572 a year,504,51951,201505
Build 500 affordable rent homes every year,409,51951,201505
and eight halfway house hostels for homeless veterans,409,51951,201505
"Remove stamp duty on the first £250,000 for new homes built on brownfield sites.",409,51951,201505
Our fiscal plans identifying how we will fund these policies have been rigorously and independently assessed by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr).,404,51951,201505
"The Cebr has been extremely diligent and has challenged us frequently, so voters can be assured our manifesto commitments are sound and affordable.",404,51951,201505
"Ours is an amazing country, but it could be better still.",601,51951,201505
As Mark Reckless said when he joined UKIP last year: “we are more than just a star on someone else’s flag.”,601,51951,201505
Our approach to the economy revolves around restoring incentives for workers by cutting taxes,701,51951,201505
and ending the current ‘open door’ arrangement for European labour that has driven down wages in recent years.,110,51951,201505
"By the end of the next parliament, UKIP will: Raise the personal allowance to at least £13,000 so people can earn enough money to cover their basic living costs before the state starts to take income tax out of their pay packets.",503,51951,201505
This will take those on minimum wage out of tax altogether,503,51951,201505
Abolish inheritance tax.,404,51951,201505
Assets bought out of taxed income should not be taxed again when their owners die.,404,51951,201505
We will strike out the hated ‘death tax.’,503,51951,201505
"It hits the middle classes hardest, those who have worked to provide for their dependents, because the wealthiest almost always manage to avoid paying it",503,51951,201505
"Raise the threshold for paying 40 per cent income tax to £55,000",404,51951,201505
"and introduce a new intermediate tax rate of 30 per cent on incomes ranging between £43,500 and £55,000.",404,51951,201505
A tax originally designed for high earners should not be levied on middle-income earners such as school teachers and senior nurses,404,51951,201505
"Increase the transferable tax allowance for married couples and civil partners to £1,500.",404,51951,201505
"The longer term aspiration of a UKIP government will be to create an income tax structure of a basic rate of 20 per cent, an intermediate rate of 30 per cent, and a top rate of 40 per cent, meaning income taxes will be flatter and lower.",404,51951,201505
Bringing down taxes on working people at the bottom and in the middle ranges of the income scale is our priority.,503,51951,201505
"In the longer term, we will aim to restore the personal allowance to those earning over £100,000 and make 40 per cent the top rate of tax for all, as it used to be.",503,51951,201505
"Outside the EU, we will have control over VAT.",110,51951,201505
"Significantly, we will be able to deal with distortion imposed by EU legislation and zero-rate certain goods and services that have previously had VAT charged on them.",110,51951,201505
"This means we can – and will - remove VAT completely from repairs to listed buildings and sanitary products, for example.",110,51951,201505
It is grossly unfair that a few multi-national corporations have been able to access all the benefits of our thriving British consumer market without making a proper contribution to the costs of British society.,403,51951,201505
The public has every right to be angry about this.,403,51951,201505
"By restoring British tax sovereignty, which we lost when we signed up to the EU,",110,51951,201505
we will end the practice of businesses paying tax in whichever EU or associated country they choose.,403,51951,201505
Our membership of the EU enables companies to avoid paying some UK taxes with impunity and we will close this loophole.,110,51951,201505
We will also set up a Treasury Commission to monitor the effectiveness of the new Diverted Profits Tax and bring in any further measures necessary to prevent large multinational corporations using aggressive tax avoidance schemes.,403,51951,201505
Years of mismanagement by Labour and Conservative governments have left our public finances in a mess.,414,51951,201505
"The public sector deficit in 2014/15 is expected to be around £90 billion and our national debt close to £1.5 trillion, £500 billion more than it was when David Cameron took over in 2010.",414,51951,201505
This is a terrible legacy to leave our children and grandchildren.,414,51951,201505
"Interest payments on our national debt alone cost £46 billion every year: more than £700 for every man, woman and child in the country.",414,51951,201505
It is more than we are spending on defence.,104,51951,201505
"The Chancellor has failed to stick to his 2010 promise to wipe out the deficit by the end of the current parliament, despite damaging cuts to public services.",414,51951,201505
"In the March 2015 Budget, a new deficit reduction schedule was unveiled, envisaging the elimination of the deficit by the third year of the next parliament, with a surplus being recorded after that.",414,51951,201505
"While this current Treasury plan is a reasonable target, there is little public faith it will be achieved, coming as is does in the wake of previous failure.",414,51951,201505
"UKIP MPs in the next parliament will make sure the Treasury sticks to this latest plan, with no backsliding.",414,51951,201505
We will hold the next Chancellor’s feet to the fire when it comes to improving public finances.,414,51951,201505
"UKIP will make a difference by being a powerful, much-needed voice in favour of sound financial management.",414,51951,201505
UKIP will finance a fairer tax system and fund our public spending proposals by sharp reductions in spending on specified public sector programmes.,414,51951,201505
By the end of the next parliament we will: Save £9 billion a year in direct net contributions to the European Union budget by leaving the EU,110,51951,201505
"Reduce the overseas aid budget from 0.7 per cent to  0.2 per cent of GNI, matching the percentage contribution made by the USA.",109,51951,201505
This change will be phased in so projects in progress can be completed and contractual obligations met.,109,51951,201505
Annual savings will increase to £11 billion by 2019/20 and money for bilateral aid projects will not be languishing in EU bank accounts,110,51951,201505
"Save £4 billion a year in capital expenditure by scrapping the HS2 vanity project, which will benefit the few at the expense of many",414,51951,201505
Reduce spending by £5.5 billion by replacing the Barnett Formula,414,51951,201505
"The Barnett Formula is the method by which HM Treasury allocates funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",303,51951,201505
"Despite being in existence for thirty-seven years, since when we have seen devolution and significant changes in the respective countries’ fortunes, this formula has never been reviewed or updated.",303,51951,201505
"Now discredited, it was disowned by Lord Barnett himself.",303,51951,201505
UKIP believes the Barnett Formula has passed its sell-by date.,303,51951,201505
"Spending has become increasingly unfair, with Scotland receiving  a considerably higher per capita spend, despite moving towards  further tax-raising and spending powers of its own.",503,51951,201505
"Scotland receives almost £1,400 more per person in public spending than the UK average and nearly £450 more than Wales.",503,51951,201505
This is why Scotland is able to spend in a manner not possible elsewhere in the UK.,503,51951,201505
We agree with the House of Lords Select Committee on the Barnett Formula which in 2009 concluded that: The Barnett Formula results in ‘per capita allocations that are arbitrary and unfair’,503,51951,201505
Scotland has ‘markedly lower overall need than Wales’,503,51951,201505
‘The Barnett Formula should no longer be used to determine annual increases in the block grant for the devolved administration’,503,51951,201505
‘A new system which allocates resources to the devolved administrations based on an explicit assessment of their relative needs should be introduced’,503,51951,201505
‘A formula based on relative need is a practical possibility.’,503,51951,201505
"These conclusions echoed a House of Commons Justice Committee report in the same year, which stated: ‘The Barnett Formula is overdue for reform and lacks any basis in equity or logic.’",303,51951,201505
"The government of the day was urged to devise a new, needs-based formula.",305,51951,201505
Both reports have been ignored.,305,51951,201505
"UKIP will implement these recommendations within the time frame anticipated by the House of Lords Select Committee: ‘a transitional period of between three and five years, preferably no more than seven.’",303,51951,201505
"The introduction of a new system will result in substantial reductions in funding for Scotland,",503,51951,201505
"but, as the Scottish government is to have significant further powers over taxation, borrowing and spending in due course, it can make its own decision as to whether to raise taxes or cut public spending to balance the books.",301,51951,201505
"Either way, the devolved administration in Scotland will be well placed to balance its fiscal, economic and spending priorities.",301,51951,201505
"The cost to the taxpayer of the Houses of Parliament, Ministerial Departments, the Home Civil Service and Whitehall-funded quangos is huge, running into hundreds of millions of pounds every year.",303,51951,201505
UKIP believes we can make considerable savings,303,51951,201505
at the same time as improving democratic accountability.,202,51951,201505
These savings include: Reducing the size of the House of Commons and ensuring parliamentary constituencies across the country are of equal size,303,51951,201505
Abolishing government departments when their essential powers and functions can be merged into other departments.,303,51951,201505
"Such departments will include the Department for Energy and Climate Change,",303,51951,201505
"the Department for International Development,",303,51951,201505
"and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport",303,51951,201505
"Reducing the number of secretaries of state, ministers and parliamentary undersecretaries-of-state and, accordingly, the size of government",303,51951,201505
Cutting departmental running costs where they do not deliver value for money,303,51951,201505
Reducing the £7.2 million cost of paid advisers and bring more transparency to their appointment,303,51951,201505
"Abolishing unnecessary quangos such as the Cabinet Office’s ‘Big Society’ programme (£49 million),",303,51951,201505
"the National Citizen Service (£62 million),",303,51951,201505
DfID’s International Citizen Service Volunteers (£110 million),303,51951,201505
and Defra’s Waste Resource Action Programme (£15.5 million),303,51951,201505
"Clamping down on so-called ‘fake charities,’",303,51951,201505
or state-funded political activism,303,51951,201505
Ending tax-payer funded overseas junketing and non-essential ‘fact-finding’ missions,303,51951,201505
Ceasing all subsidies for bars and dining rooms in the Palace of Westminster,303,51951,201505
"Preventing MPs claiming expenses that are not incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of their duties, like every other member of society.",303,51951,201505
We anticipate investing savings made from cutting the cost of Westminster into a dedicated fund to contribute to the repair and maintenance of the beautiful and historic Palace of Westminster.,303,51951,201505
The fabric of this building has been neglected and the estimated cost of essential repairs is currently £3 billion.,303,51951,201505
Government has focused on the wrong spending priorities for far too long.,305,51951,201505
"It is time to stop wasting money on trying to be popular on the world stage, and  start tackling urgent, pressing  needs here in the UK.",601,51951,201505
By changing our spending priorities British taxpayers can get much better value for money.,414,51951,201505
UKIP will take Britain out of the red and back  into the black.,414,51951,201505
The increasing ebb and flow of people across our planet is one of the greatest issues of our time.,601,51951,201505
"In 1950s Britain, some 25,000 immigrants arrived here annually and net migration was negligible.",601,51951,201505
"Now, immigration into the UK is at an all time high:",601,51951,201505
"in the year to September 2014, 624,000 migrants moved to our island and annual net migration, which takes into account those leaving the country, now stands at 298,000, again, a new record",601,51951,201505
Nearly seven million immigrants came to the UK when the Blair and Brown Labour governments deliberately and recklessly threw open our borders between 1997 and 2010.,601,51951,201505
Over two million more have arrived since David Cameron came to power and spectacularly broke his promise to reduce net migration to the “tens of thousands…No ifs. No buts.”,601,51951,201505
"This unprecedented influx has had significant consequences on our economy, our public services, our culture and our environment.",601,51951,201505
Evidence from the EU and the UK Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee reveals how immigration has driven down wages and led to job losses for British workers.,601,51951,201505
"The sheer weight of numbers, combined with rising birth rates (particularly to immigrant mothers) and an ageing population, is pushing public services to breaking point.",601,51951,201505
"To meet demand, we must build one home every seven minutes;",601,51951,201505
we wait longer to see our GP or be treated in hospitals;,601,51951,201505
"our children are learning in schools with over-sized classes,  or having lessons disrupted by building work as schools are forced to keep expanding.",601,51951,201505
The British public has every right to be concerned.,601,51951,201505
Surveys consistently show immigration as one of the top three issues for voters.,601,51951,201505
"Yet, instead of listening, the old parties have responded with insults and contempt: even our prime ministers have labelled good, decent people ‘closet racists’ and ‘bigots.’",305,51951,201505
Immigration is not about race; it is about space.,601,51951,201505
Immigrants are not the problem; it is the current immigration system that is broken.,110,51951,201505
Our current immigration rules ignore the wishes of the British people.,601,51951,201505
They discriminate in favour of EU citizens and against the rest of the world.,110,51951,201505
The system is failing so badly that we cannot even properly identify how many people enter and leave our country.,110,51951,201505
Take back control of our borders,110,51951,201505
"Put  a  five-year  moratorium  on  immigration  for  unskilled  workers,  which will enable the unemployed already living here to find work and those already working to see wage growth",406,51951,201505
"Introduce  an  Australian-style  points  based  system  to  manage  the  number and skills of people coming into the country,",406,51951,201505
"treating all citizens of the world on a fair and equal basis as a welcoming, outward-looking country",503,51951,201505
Tackle the problem of sham marriages.,605,51951,201505
"These policies are essential if we are to give our country the breathing space it desperately needs from mass uncontrolled immigration,",406,51951,201505
"create harmonious, integrated communities,",608,51951,201505
and catch up on building the essential infrastructure needed to sustain our growing nation.,411,51951,201505
We can never control immigration while we continue to be members of the European Union.,110,51951,201505
"Until we leave, we are forced to abide by the EU’s founding, unshakable principle of the ‘free movement of people,’ meaning we cannot prevent the flow of citizens from all EU member states into Britain.",110,51951,201505
"Other political parties will promise to control immigration, but while they continue to support the UK’s membership of the EU, they are not being honest with the electorate.",110,51951,201505
"Wholly unable to control EU migration, they can only reduce numbers by slamming the door in the face of people from around the rest of the world.",110,51951,201505
"The old parties already support blatant discrimination against Commonwealth countries, with whom Britain has traditionally had long and friendly relationships.",101,51951,201505
"This inequality will at best continue and at worst increase, under their prejudicial immigration policies.",110,51951,201505
"UKIP will: Increase the numbers of Border Agency staff by 2,500",605,51951,201505
"Implement  new  border  control  technology  solutions  to ensure all passport and visa holders are counted in and out and to identify over-stayers, including those on student visas.",605,51951,201505
We will establish a Migration Control Commission to oversee operation of our Australian-style points based system.,406,51951,201505
This commission will operate under a strict mandate to significantly reduce the numbers of people migrating to the UK.,406,51951,201505
"It will determine Britain’s economic and social needs annually and then recommend how many immigrants, with what skills required, we will accept into Britain.",406,51951,201505
"Because the other parties have failed to control immigration, UKIP will limit highly-skilled work visas to 50,000 per annum,",406,51951,201505
"including those from the EU,",110,51951,201505
and apply a moratorium to unskilled and low-skilled labour over the course of the next parliament.,406,51951,201505
"UKIP has no intention of ‘pulling up the drawbridge’ to Britain, as has been suggested.",406,51951,201505
"We simply want to control who walks over it, like nearly 200 other countries worldwide.",406,51951,201505
"A new visa system will be operated on a strict principle of non-discrimination between peoples of all nations applying to work, study and visit the United Kingdom.",503,51951,201505
We will offer five principal visa categories: Work  Visas  will be issued to skilled and key workers under our Australian-style points  based system.,406,51951,201505
Workers under this scheme will be required to have medical insurance to cover both themselves and any dependent s for five years’ duration.,406,51951,201505
"During this time they will not be able to claim any benefits or non-urgent NHS treatment, unless they can be treated under any reciprocal international agreements or have been granted a specific exception by the Migration Control Commission.",406,51951,201505
"Those arriving on work visas will not be granted permanent leave to remain, however they can apply for British citizenship after five years if they have worked and paid tax here.",406,51951,201505
"Visitor visas and entry passes-We value and want to encourage tourism, however there are inequalities in the current system, which treats some nationalities more favourably than others.",406,51951,201505
"The Migration Control Commission will be charged with finding a system which enables countries with which the UK already has close ties, such as member states of the European Union and the Commonwealth, to establish reciprocal arrangements for visitor visas and term-dated entry passes.",406,51951,201505
Student visas- The international student community makes an important contribution to the UK.,406,51951,201505
"Because students are in Britain only on a temporary basis, we will categorise them separately in immigration figures.",406,51951,201505
All non-UK undergraduate and post-graduate students will be required to maintain private health insurance for the period of their study.,505,51951,201505
We will also: Review which educational institutions are eligible to enroll international students and prevent abuse of the student visa system.,406,51951,201505
Students not attending courses will have their visas withdrawn and colleges not reporting absentees will be barred from accepting international students.,406,51951,201505
Family reunion visas - It is important that British citizens and those with permanent leave to remain here can form legal family relationships with non-British citizens and we will review the family union system to ensure this basic principle is respected and applies equally to all.,503,51951,201505
"However, our key aim is to control immigration, so we will abolish the EEA family permit scheme and reinstate the primary purpose rule, meaning foreign nationals marrying British citizens will have to prove that the primary purpose of their marriage is not to obtain British residency.",406,51951,201505
Asylum visas -We will comply fully with the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees;,107,51951,201505
speed up the asylum process;,303,51951,201505
and seek to do so while tackling logjams in the system for those declined asylum status.,303,51951,201505
We will continue to honour our obligations to bona fide asylum seekers.,107,51951,201505
"We have an over-stretched NHS and a high benefits bill, partly because of the pressure from immigration.",601,51951,201505
"To combat this, all new migrants to Britain will have to make tax and national insurance contributions for five consecutive years before they will become eligible to claim UK benefits, or access to more than non-urgent NHS services, save for any exceptions stipulated by the Migration Control Commission.",601,51951,201505
"Save for current applications, approved asylum cases and family reunions, we will cease grant of ‘Permanent Leave to Remain’ status.",601,51951,201505
Those on work visas may apply for British citizenship once they have been here for five years.,601,51951,201505
We will revoke the British citizenship of those who have obtained it by fraud or deception and remove those who have obtained entry into Britain by this means.,601,51951,201505
We take the view that British citizens who choose to fight alongside terrorist organisations effectively abdicate their rights to citizenship.,601,51951,201505
We will amend the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 to make enlistment in violent armed groups or transnational terror organisations a crime,605,51951,201505
and we will seek a means to revoke their citizenship and prevent their repatriation.,601,51951,201505
There will be no amnesty for illegal immigrants.,605,51951,201505
We will increase the number of immigration compliance and enforcement teams,605,51951,201505
and review current holding and accommodation arrangements for illegal immigrants.,605,51951,201505
Foreign criminals will not be granted a visa to enter the UK,605,51951,201505
Resident migrants who commit crimes resulting in custodial sentence will have their visa revoked and they will be subject to a deportation order.,605,51951,201505
They will be detained until they are removed from the UK.,605,51951,201505
Our new immigration policies will begin when we confirm our intention to leave the EU with an ‘out’ vote in a national referendum.,110,51951,201505
Any European Union citizen who is resident in the UK at the time of the referendum will be permitted to remain and work here.,108,51951,201505
They will be able to enjoy the benefits of the UK as before and have the opportunity to apply for UK citizenship after five years.,601,51951,201505
The British people accept immigrants and are among the most welcoming and tolerant people in the world.,601,51951,201505
UKIP’s policies recognise the new openness in our world and the positive benefits controlled immigration has brought and can continue to bring to our nation.,601,51951,201505
"Only UKIP’s policies have, at their heart, sustainability, ethics and fairness.",305,51951,201505
"It is only by pursuing these policies and introducing an Australian-style points based system, that we can all be  confident immigration will benefit Britain.",601,51951,201505
Our ageing population;,504,51951,201505
"the dramatic increase in the numbers of people suffering chronic, long-term conditions;",504,51951,201505
"uncontrolled immigration, encouraged by Labour and continued under the Tories:",406,51951,201505
any one of these pressures might have been enough to bring the NHS close to breaking point.,504,51951,201505
Combine these with EU directives that have prevented essential training and endless political interference,110,51951,201505
and it is not difficult to understand why the NHS is in serious trouble.,504,51951,201505
Both Labour and the Tories have utterly failed our NHS by treating it as a political football instead of a cherished institution.,504,51951,201505
"Patients are suffering because of poor policy, made all too often purely for reasons of political expediency.",504,51951,201505
A GP appointment can no longer be guaranteed within any reasonable time frame.,504,51951,201505
Coalition cuts to social care budgets are forcing elderly people to stay in hospital for longer than they should because there is no after-care available for them.,504,51951,201505
Top-down targets forced on Accident and Emergency departments are not realistic; even some of the best hospitals cannot cope.,504,51951,201505
"Despite a chronic shortage of doctors, nurses and midwives",504,51951,201505
David Cameron’s government wasted billions on a top-down reorganisation he promised would not happen.,504,51951,201505
"Labour, which squandered money on financing capital projects at credit card rates through private finance initiatives and giving service contracts worth billions of pounds to private companies when they were in power, are now promising to repeal the Health and Social Care Act, meaning yet more billions will be wasted re-organising the NHS all over again.",504,51951,201505
Both parties administered a disastrous £12 billion NHS IT project which ultimately failed.,504,51951,201505
UKIP will take better care of taxpayers’ money.,504,51951,201505
We will put an additional £3 billion a year into the NHS in England by the end of the parliament and make sure the money is spent on frontline patient care.,504,51951,201505
"We will provide the common sense, the money, the staff, the social care funding and the vital improvements to emergency medicine that the NHS needs.",504,51951,201505
"We will fund: 8,000 MORE GPs",504,51951,201505
We will train and employ GPs to meet this current shortfall,504,51951,201505
and waive university tuition fees for new medical students who work in Britain for  five years after qualifying.,504,51951,201505
"To encourage those who have left the profession to get back into the surgery, we will fund the cost of re-training for GPs who wish to return to practice.",504,51951,201505
"To cut GP waiting times and allow GPs to spend more time actually seeing patients, UKIP will reduce the burden of data collection, target chasing, revalidation and appraisal work that interferes with the care GPs can give to patients.",504,51951,201505
"20,000 MORE NURSES",504,51951,201505
"AND  3,000 MORE MIDWIVES",504,51951,201505
"Not only will UKIP find the training of nurses and midwives, we will also fund return to practice training for those who have taken career breaks.",504,51951,201505
"Because we believe nursing starts and ends on the ward, we will bring back the State Enrolled Nurse, and put care and compassion back at the heart of nursing.",504,51951,201505
"There is a shortage of emergency medicine consultants in our Accident and Emergency departments, just 1200 when the profession needs closer to 2000.",504,51951,201505
"The problem stems not so much from a deficiency in training capacity, but from poor retention once registrars or consultants have qualified.",504,51951,201505
"500 UK-trained emergency medicine consultants are currently working in Australia, New Zealand and Canada alone, which illustrates the attrition rate.",504,51951,201505
"Bodies representing this field of medicine believe the solution lies in improving working conditions, such as the extent of weekend cover, unsocial hours, extended shifts and leave patterns.",504,51951,201505
"Funding the additional consultants is not in itself a problem, as the cost of locums to cover the current shortage far exceeds that of increasing employed staff and this is what we will do.",504,51951,201505
"Patients who cannot get a GP appointment frequently turn up in A&E instead, putting additional pressure on already over-stretched resources.",504,51951,201505
We will initiate pilot programmes in English hospitals to put GPs on duty in A&E departments seven days a week.,504,51951,201505
"If these pilots succeed in easing the burden on A&E staff by freeing them up to treat seriously ill patients more successfully, we will roll the programme out across the country, deploying approximately 1,000 of the 8,000 additional GPs we are committed to funding.",504,51951,201505
Patients with mental health problems frequently feel ignored and let down.,504,51951,201505
UKIP takes a ‘whole  person’ approach to health and that means giving mental health parity with physical health.,504,51951,201505
"We will introduce practical policies to improve delivery of mental health services, including:",504,51951,201505
Directing patients diagnosed with a debilitating long-term condition or terminal illnesses to mental health professionals when appropriate,504,51951,201505
Recognising there is often a link between addiction and mental illness and offering appropriate treatment where this is the case,504,51951,201505
Offering direct access to specialist mental health treatment for pregnant women and mothers of children under 12 months of age,504,51951,201505
Fighting the stigma around mental illness,504,51951,201505
and supporting those seeking to get back into work.,504,51951,201505
Patients experiencing distress or exhibiting mental ill-health issues when admitted to hospital should have both their physical health and mental wellbeing assessed.,504,51951,201505
This must not just be an optional extra: we will end the postcode lottery for psychiatric liaison services in acute hospitals and A&E departments.,504,51951,201505
"To fund these initiatives, we will increase mental health funding by £170 million annually, phasing this in through the first two years of the next parliament.",504,51951,201505
This debilitating and distressing condition is the leading cause of death among women over the age of 55 and the fifth biggest killer of men.,504,51951,201505
We will be investing a full extra £130 million a year into researching and treating dementia by 2017.,504,51951,201505
UKIP will put the ‘national’ back into our national health service,504,51951,201505
We need to get tough on so-called ‘health-tourism.’,505,51951,201505
Every year the NHS spends up to  £2 billion of UK taxpayers’ money treating those ineligible for free care.,505,51951,201505
This bill includes foreign nationals who come to Britain to deliberately seek NHS services at no cost to themselves;,505,51951,201505
those who live here but who do not qualify for free care;,505,51951,201505
treatment for illegal immigrants and those who overstay their visas.,505,51951,201505
"The NHS is the National Health Service, not the International Health Service.",505,51951,201505
UKIP will insist migrants and visitors who come to Britain have approved medical insurance.,505,51951,201505
Only those who have the permanent right to remain in Britain and who have paid UK taxes for at least five years will be granted an NHS number and be eligible for the full services offered by the NHS.,505,51951,201505
"Urgent medical treatment will still be given to those who need it, but non-urgent treatment will be charged for.",505,51951,201505
UKIP is the only party that is truly willing to face up to the harsh reality of how health tourism and treating those ineligible is sapping the NHS of funds.,505,51951,201505
The other parties have their heads stuck well and truly in the sand.,505,51951,201505
Hospital car parking charges are a tax on the sick.,504,51951,201505
We will invest £200 million to make parking at English hospitals free for patients and their visitors.,504,51951,201505
We think NHS managers should be subject to disciplinary oversight in the same way as doctors and nurses who are regulated by the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council.,504,51951,201505
"We will introduce a ‘Licence to Manage’ as a statutory requirement to prevent incompetent, negligent or bullying managers being moved sideways or re-employed by the NHS as external consultants.",504,51951,201505
We will also abolish Monitor and the Care Quality Commission and place their inspectorate functions into the hands of county health boards made up of health and social care professionals elected locally by their peers.,301,51951,201505
"County health boards will have the power to inspect health services, conduct snap inspections and take evidence from whistleblowers.",301,51951,201505
"They will be charged with a statutory duty to investigate concerns flagged up by their local Healthwatch or local authority Health Scrutiny panels, so local democratic control and accountability is brought to healthcare decisions directly affecting our local communities.",301,51951,201505
"When short-sighted politicians are desperate for votes, they make appalling decisions.",305,51951,201505
Labour’s Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scandal is a case in point.,305,51951,201505
"By the time the £14 billion capital cost of NHS PFI contracts have run their course, the NHS will have been forced to pay out a total of £76 billion.",305,51951,201505
"UKIP will not continue to privatise the NHS by the back door, as both Labour and the Conservatives have done.",413,51951,201505
We will end the use of PFI contracts within the NHS.,413,51951,201505
Numerous EU Directives prevent medical institutions from operating in the best interests of patients.,110,51951,201505
"We will scrap at least two of them: the EU Clinical Trial Directive, which has led to a substantial drop in clinical research and threatened Britain’s position as a world-class leader in this field;",110,51951,201505
"and the EU Working Time Directive which, by limiting working and training time to 48 hours in any one week, prevents medics learning essential new skills, putting patient care at risk.",110,51951,201505
TTIP is a proposed EU/USA free trade agreement that is being negotiated in secret by the EU Trade Commission and other EU bureaucrats.,110,51951,201505
"There is growing concern that TTIP may compel us to put many of our public services up for sale to US companies, thereby privatising significant parts of our NHS.",413,51951,201505
"UKIP is committed to securing the exclusion of the NHS, by name, from TTIP.",413,51951,201505
"The level of public concern around TTIP makes it a good example of what can potentially go wrong while we remain in the EU and allow EU Commissioners to negotiate every single trade agreement on behalf of twenty-eight member states, including the UK, en bloc.",110,51951,201505
Fears of what TTIP might contain precisely illustrate why UKIP believes we should leave the EU and negotiate our own free trade agreements again.,110,51951,201505
"We find it astonishing that other political parties, while launching high-profile campaigns against TTIP, nevertheless remain committed to our EU membership.",110,51951,201505
Their hypocrisy is shameless.,110,51951,201505
The coalition cuts went deep.,504,51951,201505
"UKIP will increase social care funding by £1.2 billion each year, phasing in this increase over a two-year period, to bring investment back to 2010 levels and pay for the additional residential, nursing and home care services that are so desperately needed.",504,51951,201505
"According to Age UK, 900,000 older people between the ages of 65 and 89 have social care needs that are not met.",504,51951,201505
"Residential care, nursing care, home care, day care and equipment budgets have been cut.",504,51951,201505
"Meals on Wheels services have been scrapped in some areas, or frozen ready-meals have replaced freshly cooked hot food.",504,51951,201505
These cuts impact on the NHS: one million hospital bed days are lost every year when patients cannot be discharged because there is no after-care available for them.,504,51951,201505
Operations are cancelled for the same reason.,504,51951,201505
How we look after our older people and others who are vulnerable in society because of ill health is a mark of how civilised we are as a society.,606,51951,201505
It is scandalous that the current care system is failing those who most need our help.,606,51951,201505
We believe putting back the investment that was taken away by the current government is more than expedient: it is our duty.,606,51951,201505
The £1.2 billion UKIP will invest every year by the end of the next parliament will fund social care directly and ease the path through a change we want to make to the way the current system is financed.,504,51951,201505
"While local authorities manage social care, the NHS manages health.",504,51951,201505
"This makes for a complex, inefficient and fragmented approach.",504,51951,201505
"While attempts to integrate the two, while keeping funding and responsibilities separate, have been commendable, the common sense, long-term solution is simply to fully integrate health and social care.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP will bring health and social care together, under the control of the NHS.",504,51951,201505
"In 2010, the Commission on Funding of Care and Support, chaired by Andrew Dilnot, was tasked by Government with reviewing the funding system for care and support in England.",504,51951,201505
"It concluded that an individual’s contribution to social care costs should be capped at £35,000.",504,51951,201505
"We agree in principle: easing the burden on the growing numbers of families who face ever-increasing elderly care costs is clearly desirable, if currently unaffordable.",504,51951,201505
"We propose a possible future solution: the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth Fund from any tax revenue received from shale oil and gas exploration, with investment returns ring-fenced to fully implement the Commission’s recommendations.",504,51951,201505
"The viability of this proposal clearly depends on several unknowns, not least getting the go-ahead for shale exploration and unpredictable market forces, but we feel it is important to state this policy as an intention.",504,51951,201505
"Should fracking in the UK prove to be possible and profitable, we want to see the nation’s income from it spent on looking after older people.",504,51951,201505
"Establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund from the tax profits of fracking, and ring-fencing the income it generates for a social care fund, will  potentially release older people from the distress of having to sell their  homes to pay for care and give them and their families peace of mind.",504,51951,201505
UKIP believes the elderly and vulnerable must be treated with compassion and dignity.,504,51951,201505
We will: Introduce a legally-binding ‘Dignity Code’ to improve standards of professional care,504,51951,201505
"Pledge to protect services such as day care, home care and Meals on Wheels",504,51951,201505
Abolish the practice of arranging home care visits in fifteen-minute windows,504,51951,201505
"Abolish the annual assessment process for continuing healthcare funding in respect of those suffering from degenerative, terminal illnesses",504,51951,201505
"Keep free bus passes,",504,51951,201505
"winter fuel allowances,",504,51951,201505
free TV licenses for the over 75s,504,51951,201505
"and free prescriptions and eye tests for the over-60s, without means testing.",504,51951,201505
"We will also fund a co-ordinating service for older people in every county, combining resources from across the NHS, social services, community agents and the voluntary sector.",504,51951,201505
No vulnerable person should feel isolated or alone and this service will be proactive in identifying and assisting those suffering from loneliness.,504,51951,201505
"Good home care starts with good home care workers, who provide a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.",701,51951,201505
Theirs is a difficult enough job to do at the best of times and long hours and low pay make an already challenging role even more onerous.,701,51951,201505
We cannot expect workers to give the best care if they themselves are not being cared for.,701,51951,201505
This is a serious issue UKIP will tackle head-on.,701,51951,201505
We will not allow the NHS or third parties under contract to employ home care workers on zero hour contracts of  any kind.,701,51951,201505
Neither will we allow them to end up being paid less than the minimum wage because they are expected to travel between appointments in ‘their own time.’,701,51951,201505
We will insist they are paid for the entire time they are on duty.,701,51951,201505
"We believe that as Britain’s largest employer, the NHS should set an example.",701,51951,201505
Pensions have changed considerably since 2010.,504,51951,201505
The state pension has been simplified to a single-tier.,504,51951,201505
The need to apply for pension credit (which often went unclaimed) has been removed.,504,51951,201505
"The ‘triple lock’ now guarantees the state pension will increase each year by  the higher of inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent.",504,51951,201505
There is greater flexibility in how  personal pensions can be accessed.,504,51951,201505
These are all welcome reforms.,504,51951,201505
Raising the retirement age to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028 is hugely unpopular.,504,51951,201505
"It has been especially tough for women, who until 2010 could retire at 60.",504,51951,201505
"Also, millions of people who can now withdraw unlimited amounts from their personal pension pot may not be well-informed enough to make the best onward investments, or avoid falling victim to scams.",504,51951,201505
"When you have looked forward to retirement, short-notice changes to the state pension age can wreck long-term plans.",504,51951,201505
UKIP will give pensioners some choice over the age at which they choose to retire.,504,51951,201505
"We will introduce a flexible state pension window, which will widen over time, so even when the state pension age increases to 69, pensioners will still be able to take a slightly lower weekly state pension from the age of 65.",504,51951,201505
Pensioners will know how much less they will be paid at the time they make their decision.,504,51951,201505
"At the moment, you can delay taking your state pension in return for a slightly higher amount, so UKIP’s proposal merely extends the option in the other direction.",504,51951,201505
This proposal will be cost-neutral to the state over time.,504,51951,201505
"A flexible state pension window already works well in other countries, notably Italy, Norway, Sweden and Finland, so there is no reason why it will not work in the UK.",504,51951,201505
With greater freedom over personal pensions comes individual responsibility for retirement finance planning.,504,51951,201505
"Historically, people have had limited options of when to draw down funds from their personal plans.",504,51951,201505
"Most were forced to take out an annuity, paid out evenly, over the course of their retirement.",504,51951,201505
"Pensioners will now be making complex decisions about when and how much to take from their pension pots and, before doing so, they need expert advice to make sound, well-informed choices.",504,51951,201505
All pensioners get from the current government is 45 minutes of advice provided by the Pensions Advisory Service or Citizens Advice Bureau.,504,51951,201505
This is completely inadequate when potentially life-changing decisions are at stake.,504,51951,201505
UKIP will fund a higher standard of independent advice available to all pensioners.,504,51951,201505
"We will double the budget for guidance in 2015/16 from £30 million to £60 million,",504,51951,201505
and treble the 2016/17 budget from £10 million to £30 million.,504,51951,201505
"In consultation with bodies such as the Chartered Insurance Institute and the Personal Finance Society, we will develop a pensions advice and seminar programme that will help protect pensioners’ best interests and savings.",504,51951,201505
A further concern is that pensioners with limited financial experience may become the victims of mis-selling when they cash in their pension pots and have access to potentially large sums of money.,504,51951,201505
"To prevent mis-selling, UKIP will make it a criminal offence to cold call someone in respect of their pension arrangements.",605,51951,201505
This will not affect regulated advisors or pension schemes where there is already an existing relationship with a client.,504,51951,201505
"Rogue, unregulated operators must not be allowed to take advantage of pensioners while lining their own pockets.",605,51951,201505
"On 8th November 2014, the Government announced that war widows and widowers would receive a war widows’ pension for life, even after remarriage, with effect from April 2015.",504,51951,201505
"However, this change was not retrospective and is therefore manifestly unfair.",504,51951,201505
"We will give all war widows and widowers a war pension, regardless of when they may have remarried.",504,51951,201505
"“Circumstances can conspire against any one of us to leave us unemployed, seriously ill and unable to work, perhaps even facing bankruptcy and homelessness.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP is fully committed to maintaining a strong and supportive safety net for those who fall on hard times, whether through any fault of their own or not.”",504,51951,201505
"We want to see a welfare system that is fairer, simpler and less open to abuse.",504,51951,201505
"Our approach is one that firmly opposes the ‘benefits lifestyle’ but also addresses the current welfare regime, which has produced unjust outcomes.",505,51951,201505
Our common sense approach to benefits includes: - Supporting a lower cap on benefits,505,51951,201505
Cracking down on benefit fraud,505,51951,201505
Ending welfare tourism with a five-year ban on benefits for migrants,505,51951,201505
Stopping child benefit being paid to children who don’t live in the UK,505,51951,201505
Limiting child benefit to two children for new claimants.,505,51951,201505
The ‘bedroom tax’ is clearly unfair and is not working.,504,51951,201505
Changes to the way housing benefit is paid are leading some tenants to fall into debt.,504,51951,201505
The Conservative threat to withdraw Housing Benefit from the under-25s may cause even more suffering.,504,51951,201505
UKIP will: Scrap the ‘bedroom tax’,504,51951,201505
Continue to pay Housing Benefit to young people under the age of 25,504,51951,201505
"Give tenants the right to request Housing Benefit is paid direct to their landlords, whatever benefit scheme they are on.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP is fully committed to protecting the rights of disabled people, as set out in Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.",201,51951,201505
"We wholly endorse the right of the disabled to access in-home, residential and community support services and we support their inclusion in our communities.",201,51951,201505
We also recognise that there will always be disabled people who are unable to work and we are committed to supporting them through a fair and fit-for-purpose welfare system.,504,51951,201505
"We will end unfair ATOS-style Work Capability Assessments and return assessments to GPs or appropriate specialist consultants, who have full access to patients’ medical records and are likely to know the patient.",504,51951,201505
We believe this makes them the best person to undertake assessments and we will ensure they are adequately funded and resourced to take on this task.,504,51951,201505
"We will also: Require GPs/specialists to notify the Department for Work and Pensions when they believe a patient is well enough to return to work, by issuing a ‘fit note’",504,51951,201505
"Remove ‘tick-box’ and quota arrangements from sickness and disability assessments, thereby streamlining and speeding up the assessment processes",303,51951,201505
and continually respecting claimants throughout the process,504,51951,201505
"Millions give up work, or work reduced hours, to care for elderly or disabled relatives.",504,51951,201505
"In doing so, they make a huge contribution to society, although often at great personal and financial cost.",504,51951,201505
"We will: Increase Carers’ Allowance from £62.10 per week to match the higher level of Job Seekers Allowance, currently £73.10 per week, an extra £572 per year",504,51951,201505
Improve carers’ access to support by sharing information on benefit and social care entitlements and support groups across all public services.,504,51951,201505
It is deeply regrettable that there is increasing demand for foodbanks in 21st century Britain.,504,51951,201505
"If those who attend foodbanks are in such dire straits that they need food handouts, there is a high likelihood that they will also need additional support to deal with issues such as debt, family breakdown, addiction and poor physical or mental health.",504,51951,201505
Many will need employment or legal advice.,504,51951,201505
We will therefore contribute to the important work done by foodbanks and develop them into community advice centres for those most in need.,504,51951,201505
"UKIP will train and fund the cost of 800 advisers to work in 800 foodbanks, so the poorest in our society have free and easy access to timely help in their hour of need.",504,51951,201505
We will also exempt foodbanks and charity shops from charges imposed by local authorities to dispose of unwanted food waste and other goods.,403,51951,201505
They are not ‘businesses’ in the sense most of us understand the term and therefore should not be expected to pay fees for waste disposal.,403,51951,201505
“UKIP believes supporting children and families is a prerequisite for a strong and healthy society.,504,51951,201505
"Families are important, in all their diversity, and we want to help create a society in which they thrive and where childcare provision is affordable and accessible for all parents, whatever their socio-economic status.”",504,51951,201505
"Good childcare benefits parents, helps child development and supports our economy.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP’s vision for childcare is a system where parents, teachers, schools, nurseries, children’s centres, local authorities, childcare providers and businesses all work together to make provision as affordable, flexible, available and as high-quality as possible.",504,51951,201505
The policies of current and previous governments have been counterproductive in many ways: over-regulation has helped create an acute shortage of places and voucher systems have contributed to pushing up the cost of childcare.,504,51951,201505
"UK childcare costs are now the most expensive in Europe, and among the highest in the world.",504,51951,201505
Costs can be crippling for ordinary families.,504,51951,201505
What is  the point of having a childcare system that is so expensive it does not pay  to work?,504,51951,201505
"Children from socially deprived backgrounds are adversely affected because their applications for places are most likely to be turned down, especially if parents are unable to pay for ‘top-ups’ such as meals, nappies and so on.",504,51951,201505
Childcare provision is also complex and fragmented.,504,51951,201505
Several government departments oversee different schemes providing help with childcare costs.,504,51951,201505
Parents may struggle to work out which type of childcare funding system will work best for them.,504,51951,201505
Those on modest incomes who work hard may find they ‘fall through the gaps.’,504,51951,201505
"Parents who are self-employed, agency workers, those on zero-hours contracts or commission are most likely to be affected, as any rise in income may prove punitive, depending on which childcare support scheme has been chosen.",504,51951,201505
"A simpler system, more responsive to families’ changing needs and with integrated sources of funding, must be initiated at the earliest opportunity,",504,51951,201505
"alongside proposals to reduce the cost of childcare and increase the number of childcare places, while giving parents more choice.",504,51951,201505
We will initiate a full review of childcare provision.,504,51951,201505
"UKIP will continue to fund the current childcare offer of fifteen hours a week of free childcare at a nursery, preschool, or for a childminder, for all three to four year olds,",504,51951,201505
and for all two-year olds whose parent are on certain benefits.,504,51951,201505
"We will also honour the current Government’s commitment to providing a new tax-free childcare scheme, worth up to £2,000 for children under twelve.",504,51951,201505
"However, we will amend the voucher scheme in order to address the shortage of places and cut the cost to both parents and the state, by de-regulating childcare provision.",504,51951,201505
"At the moment, if parents want to claim their free childcare entitlement, they must place their child with an Ofsted-registered childminder.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP will remove this requirement and allow parents to use any third-party, non-related child carer they feel comfortable placing their child with, provided the care provided can be proven to be genuine.",504,51951,201505
"This is intended to encourage experienced parents whose own children have grown up, for instance, or who would like to combine looking after other people’s children alongside their own, to offer childcare.",504,51951,201505
"Our plans will also make it cost-effective for parents to hire a nanny if they have more than one young child, or enable parents to club together to hire a nanny.",504,51951,201505
"While parents should of course make their own enquiries as to the suitability of informal providers, in the same way they would check out a babysitter, we will require informal child carers to satisfy the following criteria to benefit from the voucher scheme: -",504,51951,201505
They must pass a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check,504,51951,201505
They must hold relevant household and public liability insurance,504,51951,201505
"They must not look after more than six children up to the age of eight (including any of their own children), of which a maximum of three can be under fives",504,51951,201505
A single childminder may only care for one child under one year old,504,51951,201505
The building from which they operate (unless it is the child’s own home) must be notified to the local authority and be subject to spot checks.,504,51951,201505
"This combination of de-regulation, practical solutions and incentives will reduce childcare costs,",504,51951,201505
increase childcare availability,504,51951,201505
and make it easier for parents to find flexible childcare that works around their working hours and lifestyle.,504,51951,201505
UKIP will make consideration of the necessity to include nursery or creche provision an essential part of the planning process for large developments.,504,51951,201505
"We will also amend planning legislation to ensure planning applications for family housing developments of forty homes or more, without dedicated garden space for each unit, will be required to include a communal play area in each scheme.",504,51951,201505
We will also allow office space to be converted to nursery facilities under permitted development rights.,504,51951,201505
"We will also ask employers to pool nursery provisions for all families within the local community, where ever possible.",504,51951,201505
Tackling excessive regulation without compromising child safety is a priority.,504,51951,201505
"Nurseries are often small businesses and we would prefer owners to be focused on childcare, rather than drowning in paperwork.",504,51951,201505
"For parents of school-age children, extending the school day by offering wrap-around childcare will offer enormous benefits to working parents, for whom it is likely to be by far the most sensible and convenient childcare option.",504,51951,201505
"We will place a statutory duty on all primary schools to offer before and after-school care from 8am to 6pm during term time, with the option to extend this to all-day provision throughout the school holidays.",504,51951,201505
Sessions will include breakfast and healthy snacks.,504,51951,201505
,504,51951,201505
Schools can choose how they facilitate before and after-school care.,504,51951,201505
They can provide it themselves; partner with external childcare providers; or allow parents to club together.,504,51951,201505
"There will be no cost to the school, as parents will pay for the cost of childcare themselves or use the voucher scheme.",504,51951,201505
"Local authorities will be required to keep a register of child care providers willing to offer emergency childcare cover at short notice, during atypical hours, overnight, or at weekends.",504,51951,201505
"This will help families who need to access high quality care during unsocial hours, in an emergency, when they are called to a job interview at short notice, or when they are working away from home, for example.",504,51951,201505
"UKIP will reform the care system so the 68,000 children in care in the UK (including 3,600 under the age of one) can find stability through fostering and adoption in a faster, more efficient way.",504,51951,201505
"We will extend the provisions of the Children and Families Act 2014, which gives children in care the choice to stay with their foster families until they turn 21, to children in homes, so they too have the same opportunity.",504,51951,201505
UKIP wants fathers to be more involved in their children’s lives.,503,51951,201505
"To help prevent thousands of fathers losing contact with their children each year when couples break up, UKIP will legislate for an initial presumption of 50-50 shared parenting in child residency matters.",503,51951,201505
"Grandparents will also be given visiting rights, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Family Court that there is a good reason to withhold such rights.",503,51951,201505
"We will also review the Family Court system, with the intention of implementing independent lay oversight of Family Courts, to ensure that necessary confidentiality does not prevent proper scrutiny in this and all areas of Family Law.",303,51951,201505
"A misplaced sensitivity to issues of race and religion, combined with fear, has been shown to have stopped many investigations into the abuse of children.",504,51951,201505
There is also concern among the public at rising levels of ‘forced’ adoptions.,504,51951,201505
Some of those charged with protecting children in care are letting serious cases of abuse and maltreatment slip through the net.,504,51951,201505
Our children’s wellbeing lags behind many of our European neighbours and we are seeing alarming rates of self-harm and poor mental health.,504,51951,201505
"UKIP is committed to bringing forward a full, open review of all childcare and child protection services in Britain, with a view to initiating wholesale reform of a system that is clearly failing.",504,51951,201505
"Our children deserve better and UKIP will investigate failings without fear or favour to deliver a safer, brighter, fairer future for our children.",504,51951,201505
“UKIP’s vision for British education is of a world-renowned system;,601,51951,201505
"a system designed to allow young people to perform to the best of their ability, regardless of background, gender, race, wealth or class.”",503,51951,201505
It is morally wrong that five independent fee-paying schools should send more students to Oxbridge than the worst performing two thousand secondary schools combined,503,51951,201505
and that more students from the state sector attended Oxbridge in the 1960s than do so now.,503,51951,201505
We believe it is the duty of the state to ensure high quality education is provided for all.,506,51951,201505
"To achieve this, we will build our education policy upon three key principles: -",506,51951,201505
1.  Education must be responsive to individual needs,506,51951,201505
"Children have widely different aptitudes and capabilities and, crucially, they develop at different rates.",506,51951,201505
Our school system and our whole approach to education should be more flexible than it is now.,506,51951,201505
2.  Good teachers are paramount The quality of education is almost entirely dependent on the quality of teaching.,506,51951,201505
We need the best people to choose to teach and we need to keep them teaching.,506,51951,201505
"To achieve this, we must ensure not only that teachers are well-prepared for a teaching career, but also that they have a high status in society and feel valued.",506,51951,201505
3.  The importance of primary education,506,51951,201505
"A child’s first experience of education is vitally important, as this is when the pattern for learning is laid down and when literacy and good social skills are established.",506,51951,201505
Too many teachers are working excessive hours and struggling to find an acceptable work-life balance.,506,51951,201505
"We do not want stressed, overworked teachers in our classrooms.",506,51951,201505
Their workloads must be eased.,506,51951,201505
"We will decrease the amount of paperwork teachers deal with, such as overly detailed individual lesson plans, data collection, excessive internal assessments and dialogue-based marking schemes.",506,51951,201505
"The plethora of centralised targets will be streamlined and lesson observations limited to a maximum of one each term, except when there are concerns about teaching performance that appraisal processes have been unable to address.",506,51951,201505
"Enforcing the current restriction on class sizes to thirty pupils and aiming to reduce this to twenty-five pupils over time, will further ease teacher workloads – not least when it comes to marking -",506,51951,201505
as well as ease parental concerns about large class sizes.,506,51951,201505
"We will scrap teachers’ performance-related pay, which the NUT describes as having ‘increased bureaucracy and working hours’ and does not adequately reflect teaching ability.",506,51951,201505
"UKIP will abolish Key Stage 1 SATs, set at the age of seven, as these tests have destructive, unintended consequences:",506,51951,201505
"they encourage ‘teaching to the test,’",506,51951,201505
"they narrow the curriculum and,",506,51951,201505
"often, they put pressure on teachers to concentrate disproportionate resources and time on borderline pupils.",506,51951,201505
"Worst of all, these tests create anxiety for everyone – children, teachers, parents, school governors – at exactly the time when children should be learning to learn, to enjoy the experience and to think of school as a fun and rewarding place to be.",506,51951,201505
"To increase the uptake of science learning at secondary level, we will follow the recommendations of the Campaign for Science and Engineering and require every primary school to nominate (and train, if necessary) a science leader to inspire and equip the next generation.",506,51951,201505
This role will also help to address the gender imbalance in the scientific subjects.,503,51951,201505
"We support age-appropriate sex and relationship education at secondary level, but not for primary school children.",506,51951,201505
"There is a world of difference between teaching young children about online safety or telling them no one else is allowed to touch the private parts of their body, which is a sensible way to help prevent and encourage reporting of abuse and going into too much detail.",506,51951,201505
"The latter risks sexualising childhood, causing confusion and anxiety, and encouraging experimentation.",506,51951,201505
"We will also rule that all parents must be made fully aware of the sex education teaching materials being used, before their children see it,",506,51951,201505
and we will continue to respect their right to withdraw children from sex-education classes if they wish.,506,51951,201505
"UKIP will push for a range of different types of school, including grammar, vocational, technical and specialist secondary schools within a geographical area.",506,51951,201505
"This will make our secondary school system more responsive to the differing aptitudes, capabilities and speed of development of our children.",506,51951,201505
"In stark contrast to the other main parties, who have persistently campaigned against them, UKIP supports grammar schools.",506,51951,201505
Demand for places far outstrips supply and UKIP will give existing secondary schools the opportunity to become grammar schools.,506,51951,201505
Many pupils learn best in a rigorous academic environment and the system can improve social mobility for able children from poorer backgrounds.,506,51951,201505
"We want to foster academic education among bright poorer students still further,",506,51951,201505
"and ultimately, UKIP wants to see a grammar school in every town.",506,51951,201505
"We recognise that the old 11+ selective system was not perfect, so we will ensure attendance is not based on a onetime fixed test and introduce transfer examinations taken later at ages 12, 13 and 16, to pick up pupils who develop in an academic direction, but at a slightly slower pace.",506,51951,201505
"As well as allowing existing schools to become grammar schools, we will allow other establishments to become vocational schools or colleges similar to those promoted in Germany and The Netherlands, so pupils develop practical skills.",506,51951,201505
"Further, by linking vocational schools and colleges with industry, we will introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship qualification instead of four non-core GCSEs.",506,51951,201505
"Students can then continue their apprenticeships past the age of 16, working with certified professionals qualified to grade their progress.",506,51951,201505
"Reintroduce the Intermediate tier at GCSE Mathematics, to ensure Foundation and Intermediate tiers are skills-based and that the Higher tier is a rigorous preparation for A Level",506,51951,201505
"Abolish the AS level exam as a stepping stone to a full ‘A’ level, while retaining it as a standalone qualification in its own right for those who choose to approach it as such.",506,51951,201505
"If young students want to take a full ‘A’ level, they may as well start the essential in-depth learning immediately and escape the stressful treadmill of continuous examinations from 16 onwards.",506,51951,201505
This move has the additional advantage of releasing an extra six weeks of lessons during the summer term between GCSEs and A levels,506,51951,201505
"Make First Aid training a statutory part of Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) in the national curriculum.",506,51951,201505
We will learn from the French system where pupils can obtain a ‘Basic Life-Saving Diploma’ at the end of secondary school.,506,51951,201505
This will include instruction in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for all secondary school pupils,506,51951,201505
"Fund all secondary schools according to a single formula, taking into account Special Educational Needs, to ensure underfunding such as that for secondary moderns in the 1950s can never be repeated.",506,51951,201505
The policy of closing special schools will be reversed.,506,51951,201505
Every child is unique and the needs of each child should come first.,506,51951,201505
"Those who learn better in a tailored, non-mainstream environment should have the opportunity to do so.",506,51951,201505
"Ofsted inspections will be streamlined to focus on the quality of teaching, learning and the overall wellbeing of children, rather than paperwork, school policies or tick-box targets.",506,51951,201505
"Inspections will be shorter, classroom-orientated, and more transparent.",506,51951,201505
"We will continue to monitor British values, but with a view towards combatting extremism and radicalisation, rather than criticising widely-held Judeo-Christian beliefs.",603,51951,201505
Teachers with at least fifteen years’ successful classroom experience will be prioritised when Ofsted inspectors are recruited:,506,51951,201505
teachers are right to question whether they should be judged by those who have less classroom experience than themselves.,506,51951,201505
Schools will be subject to additional investigations by Ofsted if 25 per cent of parents or governors present a petition to the Department for Education.,506,51951,201505
An independent body will hear complaints about an Ofsted inspection.,506,51951,201505
We will remove Ofsted’s right to investigate itself.,506,51951,201505
Previous government policies of pursuing higher education targets and introducing tuition fees have had a crippling effect on our young people’s finances and job prospects.,506,51951,201505
"The average student now leaves university with a debt of £44,000, yet students are less likely to find a graduate-level job than ever before.",506,51951,201505
"47 per cent of recent graduates were ‘under-employed’ in 2013, as opposed to just 37 per cent in 2001.",506,51951,201505
This marks a 27 per cent increase in the inability of graduates to get a job utilising or requiring their degree qualification.,506,51951,201505
The taxpayer fares little better: 45 per cent of all student loans have to be written-off.,506,51951,201505
"To combat this growing problem, UKIP will drop the arbitrary 50 per cent target for school leavers going to university.",506,51951,201505
We will not increase the current level of undergraduate courses until we can be sure there are sufficient vacancies in the economy to provide at least two-thirds of students with skilled graduate jobs.,506,51951,201505
"We will also encourage students to choose careers that will help fill the current skills’ gap, to both benefit Britain and set them on the path to a solid, prosperous career.",506,51951,201505
"UK students taking approved degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM), mainly at universities funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, will not have to repay their tuition fees.",506,51951,201505
"This is on condition that they work in their discipline and pay tax in the UK for at least five years, after they complete their degrees.",506,51951,201505
"Accordingly, UKIP will adjust the number of STEMM subjects funded to allow for a greater uptake of these subjects.",506,51951,201505
"We are currently obliged to give tuition fee loans to EEA students as a condition of our EU membership, but as of March 2013, only 11 per cent of EU domiciled students were making any repayments.",110,51951,201505
"As student loans include a huge subsidy from the taxpayer and because repayment rates are so low, we will not give tuition fee loans to EEA students when we leave the EU.",110,51951,201505
They will of course be welcome to apply for places at UK universities as self-supporting international students.,110,51951,201505
"UKIP supports the right of parents to home-school their children, if they choose to do.",503,51951,201505
"We will support and fund free schools, provided they are open to the whole local community,",503,51951,201505
uphold British values,601,51951,201505
and do not discriminate against any section of society.,503,51951,201505
“UKIP is the only party to recognise that a house needs to be built every seven minutes to meet demand.,403,51951,201505
"The housing shortage is leading to higher rents, less stable tenancies, and rising homelessness.",403,51951,201505
This is completely unsustainable.”,403,51951,201505
There is a dire shortage of affordable housing in Britain.,403,51951,201505
Many of those who would like to own their own home are simply unable to even contemplate it.,403,51951,201505
They are ‘locked out’ of home ownership.,403,51951,201505
Social housing waiting lists get longer and longer.,403,51951,201505
"The Thatcher era saw a dramatic extension in home ownership, but with a corresponding decline in social housing, as proceeds from the ‘Right to Buy’ initiative were not reinvested back into community housing.",403,51951,201505
"Only 23 per cent of properties are deemed ‘affordable’ nationally, but the situation is even worse in the countryside, where only 5 per cent of rural properties are affordable and social housing is more difficult to find.",403,51951,201505
"Yet no-one wants to see our green fields concreted over, or the beauty of our rural landscape destroyed.",416,51951,201505
"UKIP will introduce policies to incentivise the creation of more affordable housing,",402,51951,201505
while protecting rural communities and preserving our precious countryside.,501,51951,201505
"Housing charity Shelter reports there are 279,000 privately-owned long-term empty homes in England alone, while other bodies, such as the Empty Homes Agency, put the figure much higher still.",403,51951,201505
The most obvious way to create new homes is by bringing these empty homes back into use.,403,51951,201505
We will place a statutory duty on local authorities to:,403,51951,201505
Include a commitment to bringing empty properties back into use within their broader housing and planning strategies,403,51951,201505
"Charge those whose homes are empty for more than two years 50 per cent more than the applicable rate of council tax,",403,51951,201505
with exceptions for owners who are in HM Armed Forces.,503,51951,201505
"It would be possible to build up to 2.5 million houses on brownfield sites, if developers were less reluctant to take advantage of this rich source of potential housing land.",402,51951,201505
Problems with remediation of derelict land that has had a previous use and may have contamination issues to address can be off-putting to potential developers.,402,51951,201505
This is  despite the fact technology to  clean up sites and make them fit for new development is now readily available.,402,51951,201505
We will take steps to remove the barriers to brownfield builds with the aim of building one million homes on brownfield sites by 2025 to address the current housing shortage.,402,51951,201505
UKIP will require the Environment Agency to compile a National Brownfield Sites Register and provide a remediation assessment where appropriate.,402,51951,201505
The following financial incentives will be offered to encourage developers to build on brownfield sites:,402,51951,201505
"Grants of up to £10,000 per unit will be available to developers to carry out essential remediation work.",402,51951,201505
"Properties built on registered brownfield sites will be exempt from stamp duty on first sale, up to the £250,000 threshold.",402,51951,201505
A grant to cover the cost of indemnity insurance will also be available to developers of decontaminated land.,402,51951,201505
"To further incentivise brownfield development, local authorities will be allowed to keep the New Homes Bonus beyond six years on brownfield sites.",402,51951,201505
We will increase the supply of affordable housing by:,402,51951,201505
Identifying long-term dormant land held by central and local government so it can be released for affordable developments,402,51951,201505
Relax planning regulations for the conversion of off-high road commercial and office space and other existing buildings to affordable residential use.,402,51951,201505
"While these measures will help address the housing shortage, we cannot just build our way out of the housing crisis.",403,51951,201505
Our housing policy needs to be seen within a wider context of addressing the issue of supply and demand.,403,51951,201505
Controlling the numbers of new migrants coming to Britain is one important part of the housing jigsaw.,406,51951,201505
There are no clear national statistics to tell us how many people are homeless in the UK.,503,51951,201505
"To give an indication of the scale of the problem, the Autumn 2014 total of rough sleeping counts and estimates in England was 2,744, according to the government.",503,51951,201505
This was an increase of 14 per cent on 2013 figures.,503,51951,201505
"Meanwhile, 112,070 people declared themselves homeless in England in 2013/4.",503,51951,201505
The scale of homelessness in 2015 is morally reprehensible and UKIP will seek to eliminate this national scandal.,503,51951,201505
"Tackling homelessness starts with knowing who and where homeless people are, so they can be offered housing and other life opportunities.",504,51951,201505
We will establish a National Homeless Register to make it easier for those of no fixed abode to claim welfare entitlements;,504,51951,201505
get access to medical and dental services;,504,51951,201505
"and enable support services to identify those at risk of physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",504,51951,201505
UKIP will encourage moves by local authorities to prioritise people with strong local connections when making housing allocations.,601,51951,201505
We will relieve pressure on social housing waiting lists by preventing foreign nationals from obtaining access to social housing until they have lived here and paid UK Tax and National Insurance for a minimum of five years.,601,51951,201505
This restriction will not apply to foreign nationals with current social housing tenancies.,503,51951,201505
UKIP supports the principle of extending home ownership and giving people the right to own the homes they may have lived in for generations as social housing tenants.,503,51951,201505
"We will plough 100 per cent of all revenue from Right to Buy sales, after essential costs have been paid back, into new community housing.",504,51951,201505
"We will not allow non-British nationals access to the Right to Buy or Help to Buy schemes, unless they have served in Her Majesty’s Armed Forces.",601,51951,201505
"Given that Britain’s social housing stock is so massively oversubscribed, we do not believe it is either sensible or fair to give foreign nationals the opportunity to obtain social housing stock, buy their home at a discount and then sell it for an untaxed profit before moving back abroad.",601,51951,201505
"All local authorities, social landlords and housing associations will be required to register the nationality of their tenants in order to ensure this policy works in practice.",601,51951,201505
"In the same way, only British citizens will be permitted to access Help to Buy schemes.",601,51951,201505
UKIP will not allow new housing to strip our nation of prime agricultural land.,703,51951,201505
"This must be kept for its primary purpose, creating a secure food supply for Britain and for export.",703,51951,201505
Neither will we allow the countryside to be swamped by over-development:,416,51951,201505
we believe strongly that our countryside must be preserved so it can be enjoyed by future generations.,501,51951,201505
We will replace the current National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) and introduce fresh national planning guidelines that will prioritise brownfield sites for new housing and genuinely protect the green belt,416,51951,201505
The NPPF as it stands is disastrous for the environment.,416,51951,201505
It has given developers the green light to build just about anywhere and seriously restricts the ability of local authorities to refuse planning permission for inappropriate developments.,416,51951,201505
"The Tories promised ‘localism,’ in their 2010 Manifesto, saying they would give more power to local people but, in reality, their planning policies have stripped powers away from communities.",301,51951,201505
UKIP genuinely supports local communities having a greater say over what happens in their locality and we will:,301,51951,201505
Free local authorities from government-imposed minimum housing numbers,301,51951,201505
"Reverse current policies of facilitating large-scale rural residential developments,",416,51951,201505
Promote smaller 6-12 unit developments in rural areas to extend existing villages,416,51951,201505
Encourage local authorities to require a proportion of self-build plots to be provided in all large developments,416,51951,201505
"Allow large-scale developments to be overturned by a binding local referendum triggered by the signatures of 5 per cent of electors within a planning authority area, collected within three months",416,51951,201505
Reduce the cost and bureaucracy of planning applications by merging Planning and Building Control departments in local authorities.,303,51951,201505
"UKIP will change the law to allow mortgages to become inheritable, as they are in other countries.",403,51951,201505
This will allow lenders to resume lending to older borrowers.,403,51951,201505
UKIP will not introduce any form of ‘Mansion Tax.’,403,51951,201505
“Ours is a nation always on the move.,411,51951,201505

"In October 2013, Lord Mandelson, speaking in the House of Lords about the Labour government’s decision to instigate the HS2 high-speed rail-link confessed that: “It was a political trophy project justified on flimsy evidence.”",416,51951,201505
HS2 is running out of control.,416,51951,201505
UKIP will stop this flawed vanity scheme in its tracks.,416,51951,201505
"The estimated cost is already £50 billion and HS2 Ltd is planning to spend over £800m in 2015/2016, before the project even gets the final go-ahead.",416,51951,201505
The Government’s own estimates show the cost will never be recouped.,416,51951,201505
HS2 will blight thousands of homes and wreak irreparable environmental damage across large tracts of central England.,416,51951,201505
"The argument that HS2 is needed to provide extra capacity has just weeks ago been questioned by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which concluded that: ‘the Government has not made a convincing case for why this particular project should go ahead.’",416,51951,201505
There is barely any evidence that HS2 will reduce the North-South divide:,416,51951,201505
the north would get much quicker and higher benefit from investment in the infrastructure between northern towns and cities.,416,51951,201505
"HS2 is an unaffordable white elephant and, given other, far more pressing calls on public expenditure, such as the NHS, social care and defence, not to mention the need to reduce the deficit, it must face the axe.",416,51951,201505
The final report of the Davies Commission into airport capacity and connectivity in the UK will be published later this year.,411,51951,201505
UKIP will consider its recommendations and then take a position on the basis of what we genuinely believe to be in the long-term best interests of the country.,411,51951,201505
"However, we firmly believe that part of the solution to address the lack of airport capacity in the South East is to re-open Manston Airport.",411,51951,201505
Manston is ideally placed to take low-cost airlines and freight-only aircraft;,411,51951,201505
it is close to the railway network;,411,51951,201505
enjoys good connections to Ashford International;,411,51951,201505
will release additional capacity in the region;,411,51951,201505
and take pressure off other airports.,411,51951,201505
"UKIP will only allow installation of speed cameras when they can be used as a deterrent at accident black spots, near schools and in residential areas where there are specific potential dangers.",416,51951,201505
We will not permit speed cameras to be used as revenue-raisers for local authorities.,416,51951,201505
We will remove road tolls where possible and let existing contracts on running road tolls expire.,403,51951,201505
Motorists are already taxed highly enough through fuel and vehicle taxes.,403,51951,201505
UKIP opposes ‘pay-as-you-go’ road charging schemes and attempts to introduce them by stealth.,110,51951,201505
"From October 2015, the EU will require all new cars to be fitted with the ‘eCall’ system.",110,51951,201505
"Ostensibly a road safety measure, this system tracks vehicles using GPS and reports back to a central database.",110,51951,201505
"This capability would enable introduction of a Europe-wide road pricing system, on a miles travelled basis, which the EU Transport Commissioner is keen to introduce.",110,51951,201505
We will scrap mandatory fitments of eCall and allow owners who already have eCall installed to disable it on their vehicles.,110,51951,201505
"The Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (DCPC) is an expensive second-tier requirement, which is causing job losses, because of the added administration and expense to hauliers.",110,51951,201505
We will scrap the DCPC for professionally licensed drivers.,110,51951,201505
"This levy currently applies to HGV vehicles registered both in the UK and other EU countries, to comply with various EU directives.",110,51951,201505
"After leaving the EU the levy would cease to apply to UK vehicles, but the Vehicle Excise Duty on UK vehicles would be adjusted by the equivalent amount to make this aspect of the change revenue neutral for both UK hauliers and the government.",110,51951,201505
The current levy tariff will then be doubled to a maximum of £2000 per annum and only apply to foreign registered HGVs.,406,51951,201505
"This change will help UK hauliers to compete with European hauliers entering the UK, loaded with cheaper fuel bought on the Continent.",406,51951,201505
It will achieve exactly the same effect as UKIP’s original ‘Britdisc’ proposal.,406,51951,201505
"To help protect the enduring legacy of the motor industry and our classic and historic vehicles, UKIP will exempt vehicles over 25 years old from Vehicle Excise Duty.",408,51951,201505

"Why? Because the 2008 Climate Change Act, an Act rooted in EU folly, drives up costs, undermines competitiveness and hits jobs and growth.",110,51951,201505
"Dubbed ‘the most expensive piece of legislation in British history,’ the government’s own figures put the cost of the Act at £18 billion a year over 40 years, or £720 billion between 2010 and 2050.",110,51951,201505
The Climate Change Act is doing untold damage.,110,51951,201505
UKIP will repeal it.,110,51951,201505
We will also scrap the Large Combustion Plant Directive and stop the EU’s planned Medium Combustion Plant Directive.,110,51951,201505
"Both attempt to close down secure, reliable and economical electricity generation and replace it with expensive, intermittent, unreliable renewables.",416,51951,201505
We will encourage the re-development of British power stations and industrial units providing on-site power generation.,416,51951,201505
"To deliver secure, affordable energy supplies, we support a diverse energy market based on coal, nuclear, shale gas, conventional gas, oil, solar and hydro, as well as other renewables where these can be delivered at competitive prices.",416,51951,201505
"UKIP supports the development of shale gas, provided safeguards are in place to protect local communities and the environment.",402,51951,201505
Community Infrastructure Levy income from shale gas operations will be earmarked for lower Council Taxes or local community projects.,402,51951,201505
"No energy extraction technology is perfectly safe, but shale gas operations in the USA for instance, where tens of thousands of shale wells have been drilled and fracked over five decades, have proved remarkably unproblematic, especially so by comparison to other methods of energy extraction.",416,51951,201505
What is clearly unsafe is the UK’s over-dependence on imports from politically unstable countries.,416,51951,201505
"In the interests of energy security alone, the prospect of home-grown shale gas is an enormous opportunity it would be irresponsible to ignore.",416,51951,201505
We will levy Petroleum Revenue Tax (currently 50 per cent) on any shale profits and invest the income into a Sovereign Wealth Fund.,402,51951,201505
"Norway takes this approach, with great success.",402,51951,201505
"UKIP supports and will invest in renewables, where they can deliver electricity at competitive prices.",416,51951,201505

"so we will withdraw taxpayer and consumer subsidies for new wind turbines and solar photovoltaic arrays, while respecting existing contractual arrangements.",401,51951,201505
Wind power is hopelessly inefficient and wind farms rely heavily on reserve back-up from conventional power sources.,416,51951,201505

The British coal industry once employed one million miners.,701,51951,201505
"Now, all three remaining deep coal mines in Britain are set to close by 2016, at a cost of 2,000 jobs, despite having many years of productive life left and regardless of our continuing need for coal.",402,51951,201505
30 per cent of our electricity is still produced from coal and we will be dependent on fossil fuels for many more years to come.,402,51951,201505
"If we are to have energy security and cheap, plentiful, reliable sources of energy, coal must be part of the solution.",402,51951,201505

but UKIP will protect workers’ rights.,201,51951,201505
"The use of zero-hours contracts proliferated following the imposition of the EU’s Temporary Agency Workers Directive, which demanded agency workers were given the same workplace rights as employees.",110,51951,201505
Zero-hours contracts enabled businesses to escape this edict.,110,51951,201505
"EU legislation, intended to benefit temporary workers, in fact ended up penalising them.",110,51951,201505
"Because UKIP recognises that zero-hours contracts suit many people, we will not ban them.",701,51951,201505

"Finally, a word on the pernicious myth that leaving the EU will cost three million British jobs.",110,51951,201505
"This myth grew out of a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) in 2000, which concluded that 2.7 million jobs were directly related to our trade with the EU and another 500,000 were indirectly linked.",110,51951,201505
"The report went on to say that: “there is no a priori reason to suppose that many of these [jobs], if any, would be lost permanently if Britain were to leave the EU.”",110,51951,201505
"The report was nevertheless spun by the pro-EU lobby, which tried to suggest jobs ‘linked’ to EU trade, meant jobs were ‘dependent’ on EU membership.",110,51951,201505
"The Director of NIESR repudiated their claims, describing their efforts as ‘a wilful distortion of the facts.’",110,51951,201505
"Sadly, unscrupulous politicians, fully aware of the truth of the matter, still attempt to deceive.",110,51951,201505
The jobs of British people - and the jobs of the five million Europeans who work here – are not dependent on EU membership and will be safe when we leave the EU.,110,51951,201505

"“If you run a small business, then UKIP is the party for you.",403,51951,201505
We will do everything we can to help you be competitive in Britain and the global market.”,403,51951,201505
"At the start of last year, there were an estimated 5.2 million small businesses in the UK, together employing over 12 million people and having a combined turnover of £1.2 trillion.",403,51951,201505
We find our greatest innovators and entrepreneurs within our small businesses.,403,51951,201505
The businesses they start and grow will take us out of the economic turmoil we’ve suffered in recent years and back into the black.,403,51951,201505
"Yet, too often, our small businesses are not supported.",403,51951,201505

"Larger companies who don’t pay invoices on time, damage their cash flow.",403,51951,201505
Business rates can be prohibitively high.,403,51951,201505
"Excessive regulations stream out of Brussels, adding huge administrative and financial burdens to the challenges already faced by small businesses.",110,51951,201505
All this must stop.,403,51951,201505
"Business rates as a tax are a great burden on business and especially so on small businesses, where they represent a disproportionately high fixed cost.",402,51951,201505
"The Small Business Rate Relief currently only applies up to a rateable value of £12,000, meaning many small and medium-sized businesses receive no relief at all.",402,51951,201505
UKIP recognises this often rapidly-growing sector needs much greater support and we will change the,402,51951,201505
Small Business Rate Relief as follows:,402,51951,201505
"If  a  business  has  only  one  property  and  the  rateable  value is less than £50,000, the business will get 20 per cent rate relief",402,51951,201505
"If   the  business  has  more  than  one  property,  the  20  per cent rate relief will still apply, provided the total rateable value of all properties is less than £50,000",402,51951,201505
Other  existing  business  rate  reliefs  will  not  be  affected and will apply where the relief provided under those schemes is greater than 20 per cent,402,51951,201505
"Almost  90  per  cent  of  business  properties,  over   1.5 million in total, have a rateable value of less than £50,000, so are potentially eligible for this 20 per cent discount.",402,51951,201505
"According to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, more than £20 billion is locked up at any one time in delayed late payments from large companies (defined as a company with over 250 employees) to small suppliers of goods and services.",403,51951,201505
Small businesses find cash-flow tough enough in the current economic climate.,403,51951,201505
The last thing they need is to be bullied into providing interest-free loans to their customers.,403,51951,201505
It is not acceptable for big businesses to exploit smaller firms by deliberately delaying payments and UKIP will take firm action to stop this practice.,403,51951,201505
"Existing regulations are of little practical use: small businesses are reluctant to charge interest to customers and legal proceedings are expensive, time consuming and hardly an effective way to develop business relationships.",403,51951,201505
"UKIP will introduce a scheme whereby small businesses will provide evidence of repeated late payments, beyond agreed terms, together with evidence that timely requests for payments have been made, to HM Revenue and Customs.",403,51951,201505
Based on the evidence - particularly if there are multiple complaints about the same company -HMRC can then carry out an inspection of that company’s records.,403,51951,201505
The identity of the complainant company will remain confidential.,403,51951,201505
"If the large company is found to be systematically exceeding its contractual terms of payment with small businesses, a sanction of significant fines, proportionate to the extent of the abuse of terms, will be levied.",403,51951,201505
Fines would escalate for repeat offenders and be noted in the offending company’s statutory accounts.,403,51951,201505
"UKIP will also end a growing practice whereby large companies extend their payment terms to small companies, by arranging for their supplier to take out a bank loan to facilitate their demands.",403,51951,201505
"Despite schemes such as Funding for Lending and the Finance Guarantee, small businesses still find it difficult to secure funding in the current economic climate.",402,51951,201505
"While banks do of course have to consider risk, the lack of funding for small businesses will remain a drag on growth.",402,51951,201505
They are understandably fearful of bad debts.,402,51951,201505
"To address both this issues, UKIP will pilot a scheme to improve access to trade credit insurance to small businesses.",402,51951,201505
"This insurance already exists in the market, but can prove restrictive for smaller companies, especially in certain business sectors.",402,51951,201505
"Under our scheme, existing credit insurance providers will assess risk as they do now, independent of government involvement, but government would back a portion of the risk to enable cover to be provided more widely.",402,51951,201505
"The security this policy provides will give small businesses the confidence to expand trade, while enhancing the attractiveness of their loan book as a more secure asset against which banks can lend them money.",402,51951,201505
"If successful, this pilot will be rolled out nationally.",402,51951,201505
Businesses in our town centres – and shops in particular - have suffered as a result of the dramatic increase in out-of-town trading estates and supermarkets.,403,51951,201505
"UKIP believes our town centres should be vibrant and profitable and that means encouraging locals, visitors and tourists into town, by removing barriers that act as a disincentive, such as expensive or restricted parking.",403,51951,201505
"We will push every local authority in the country to offer at least  30 minutes free parking in town centres, high streets and shopping parades, to encourage shoppers into our town centres and boost local business.",403,51951,201505
Massive over-regulation by the European Union impacts disproportionately on smaller businesses.,110,51951,201505
"Fewer than one in ten British businesses trade with the EU, yet 100 per cent of them must comply with thousands of EU laws on employment, waste management, environmental regulations, product registration, health and safety and so on.",110,51951,201505
This burden can be overwhelming for small firms.,110,51951,201505
"A report by Business for Britain concluded that 3,580 new laws passed between 11 May 2010 and 1 October 2013 affected British business, with legislation running to over 13 million words.",110,51951,201505
"The EU’s most costly regulations cost Britain an estimated £27.4 billion a year, according to 2013 research by think-tank Open Europe.",110,51951,201505
The Federation of Small Business says 61 per cent of small companies cite the ‘regulatory burden’ as a significant factor when closing or downsizing.,110,51951,201505
UKIP will repeal EU Regulations and Directives that stifle business growth,110,51951,201505
We will also allow traders to sell in whatever quantities or measures they like.,110,51951,201505
Only UKIP will get us out of the EU and release enterprise from the strangulation excessive regulation.,110,51951,201505
"UKIP will make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses with 250 employees or less to tender for public sector contracts, by removing the necessity to demonstrate compliance in areas irrelevant to the job being tendered for.",403,51951,201505
This will benefit smaller companies and cut costs to the taxpayer.,403,51951,201505
UKIP’s support for small businesses can be seen in many other policy areas too.,403,51951,201505
"For instance, small businesses will also get a boost from our policies to: Allow  young  people  to  start  an  apprenticeship  in  place  of  four  non-core subjects at GSCE level",403,51951,201505
"Abolish  tuition  fees  for  those  studying  science,  technology,  engineering, maths and medicine",403,51951,201505
Allow  employers  to  prioritise  British  citizens  for  jobs,403,51951,201505
Maintain  suitable  levels  of  immigration  to  fill  the  skills’  gap,403,51951,201505
Cut  fuel  bills  through  the  abolition  of  ‘green  levies’  to  cut   business costs.,403,51951,201505
"UKIP believes in Britain’s small businesses, in its entrepreneurs, in its teams of sole traders, freelancers  and self-starters and will back them whenever  and however we can.",402,51951,201505
“Farmers like myself have everything to gain by leaving the EU.,110,51951,201505
"UKIP has sound policies that will put British farmers first, promote high standards in animal husbandry and help secure a vibrant, thriving agriculture sector for Britain”",703,51951,201505
"Outside the EU, free of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and excessive regulations,",110,51951,201505
"we will be able to introduce fairer, simpler ways to support farmers.",703,51951,201505
"For every £1 British agriculture receives from the CAP, the British taxpayer has already contributed £2, so we can easily continue to subsidise farmers after leaving the EU.",703,51951,201505
"We can also redistribute payments away from wealthy landowners and large, often intensively farmed holdings, in favour of smaller food producers and family farms.",703,51951,201505
"UKIP will introduce a modified UK Single Farm Payment (SFP) scheme of £80 per acre for lowland farms, with comparable arrangements for lower grades of land, capped at £120,000.",703,51951,201505
"Golf courses, airfields, racetracks and other non-productive areas will be excluded, as will land used for solar panels or land within 25 metres of a wind turbine.",703,51951,201505
"Land must conform to 2013 Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) requirements, where points are accrued according to criteria such as hedgerow maintenance, wild bird cover, wild flower mixes, etc., to qualify for subsidies.",501,51951,201505
Organic farms will be paid a 25 per cent premium on the SFP,703,51951,201505
UKIP will add rare breed maintenance to the ELS points system,703,51951,201505
"There will be no set-aside, cropping or rotation restrictions",703,51951,201505
"SFP will be paid to who ever takes financial responsibility for the farming enterprise on a field-by-field basis (i.e. the farmer, not the landowner)",703,51951,201505
Hill farmers will receive additional headage payments on livestock numbers within World Trade Organisation rules.,703,51951,201505
"UKIP will support dairy farmers by requiring the Competition Commission to promote fair practice in the food chain, in addition to considering price and competition issues.",703,51951,201505
This will allow producers to create larger cooperatives and alliances to counter the power of purchasing cartels.,703,51951,201505
"We will also refine the brief of the Grocery Adjudicator, who arbitrates on trade relationships between the large retailers and their suppliers, if necessary.",703,51951,201505
"We will scrap the Electronic Individual Identification Document for sheep,",703,51951,201505
"and introduce a pragmatic solution to distinguish between lamb and mutton at the abattoir, reducing costs for farmers by changing the definition of an ‘aged’ sheep.",703,51951,201505
"UKIP will match-fund grants made by local authorities towards rural capital projects, such as creating a lake, wetland, repairing traditional stone walls, etc. which enhance the local environment, encourage rural education, or help recovery from environmental disasters.",501,51951,201505
"While we will abolish excessive and unnecessary regulations and directives, keeping those necessary to protect our environment, or replacing them with more appropriate controls, administered at national or local government level, will be a priority for us.",501,51951,201505
We will take as our guide in these and all other farming matters relevant scientific and/or professional veterinary advice.,501,51951,201505
"UKIP supports research into GM foods, including research on the benefits and risks involved to the public.",703,51951,201505
We will allow a free vote in Parliament on commercial cultivation.,703,51951,201505
Food labelling will come back under the control of the Westminster Parliament when we leave the EU.,110,51951,201505
"Then we can insist animal products are labelled to show the country of origin, method of production and transport and whether the animal was stunned before slaughter, together with any information concerning hormones and GM products.",403,51951,201505
We believe strongly that customers have the right to see this information.,403,51951,201505
We can only regain control of animal health and welfare by leaving the EU.,110,51951,201505
UKIP takes both issues seriously and we will: Triple the maximum jail sentences for animal cruelty and torture,501,51951,201505
Impose lifetime bans on owning and/or looking after animals on any individual or company convicted of animal cruelty or torture,501,51951,201505
Keep the ban on animal testing for cosmetics,501,51951,201505
"Challenge companies using animals for testing drugs or other medical treatments on the necessity for this form of testing, as opposed to the use of alternative technology",501,51951,201505
Tightly regulate animal testing,501,51951,201505
Ban the export of live animals for slaughter,501,51951,201505
Insist on formal non-stun training and certification for all religious slaughtermen to ensure the highest standards are adhered to,501,51951,201505
"Install CCTV in every abattoir, monitored by the Meat Hygiene Service, and deal severely with any contraventions.",501,51951,201505
"Remove unnecessary EU restrictions that make small, local abattoirs unviable",110,51951,201505
We will also prepare for the possibility of disease outbreaks (including those) caused by imports.,703,51951,201505
"We cannot expect our farmers to bear the full brunt of any such outbreaks, but we will encourage them to introduce testing programmes and invest in insurance schemes to deal with potential outbreaks, as the poultry sector has done with the salmonella testing programme and associated insurance scheme.",703,51951,201505
"“By the time Trevor sells the two boxes of whelks he’s caught today, he will make the grand sum of about £45, before costs such as fuel for his boat.",110,51951,201505
EU quotas mean he’s not allowed to catch anything else.,110,51951,201505
This is how utterly ridiculous the Common Fisheries Policy is: it is destroying our fishing industry and we must take back control from Brussels.”,110,51951,201505
The EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was designed from the beginning to steal our fish.,110,51951,201505
It has ravaged our fishing industry and caused catastrophic environmental damage.,110,51951,201505
Fishing grounds have been so over-fished that some are at the point of collapse.,110,51951,201505
Our fishing fleet is half its former size.,110,51951,201505
"Britain’s seas should be the jewel in her crown, but we surrendered these priceless family treasures when we joined the then EEC 1973 and our territorial waters were merged into one giant European fishery.",110,51951,201505
The UK has almost 70 per cent of Europe’s fishing grounds but only 13 per cent percent of its fishing quota.,110,51951,201505
"So, we must import fish species such as cod, haddock and huss that our own fishermen are forced to throw overboard",110,51951,201505
– usually dead - because of EU rules.,110,51951,201505
"The EU itself estimates 40 per cent of all fish caught are discarded, so as much as two million tons of perfectly edible fish are wasted every year.",110,51951,201505
"The EU’s proposed discard ban will not fix this problem, just move it onshore.",110,51951,201505
"Worse, while preaching ‘conservation,’ the EU allows industrial fishing techniques such as electric pulse trawling, which destroys marine life and disturbs the ecological balance of our seascapes.",110,51951,201505
We can only replenish Britain’s bounty of fish and restore our fishing industry if we leave the EU and withdraw from the CFP.,110,51951,201505
Then we can: Establish a 12-mile zone around our coastline for UK fishermen,406,51951,201505
"and a 200-mile exclusive economic zone under UK control, as is our right under international law",406,51951,201505
Reverse the rapid decline in our fishing industry and return £2.5 billion a year in fish sales to the UK economy,406,51951,201505
Enforce ‘no-take’ zones to aid spawning and replenish fish stocks,406,51951,201505
Protect our coastal eco system by ending destructive industrial fishing practices,501,51951,201505
End the slaughter of dolphins by banning pair trawler fishing for bass,501,51951,201505
Work with our fishermen to solve discard and landing issues,406,51951,201505
Reverse any EU-wide drift-net ban in British waters,110,51951,201505
Issue permits for foreign trawlers once fish stocks have returned to sustainable levels.,406,51951,201505
"Smaller fishing boats make up the majority of the UK fleet but only receive only 4 per cent of the English quota, while the five largest foreign-controlled vessels take 32 per cent.",406,51951,201505
It is grossly unfair and damages fish stock sustainability.,406,51951,201505
Small-scale inshore fishing is the backbone of the UK fishing industry and we will end this injustice.,406,51951,201505
"Over 750,000 people enjoy sea angling in the UK.",110,51951,201505
"It is a profitable hobby for Britain: VAT income from sea angling is worth more than the value of all commercial landings and some 23,000 jobs depend on sea angling, yet the EU is planning to restrict anglers to catching just three sea bass a day.",110,51951,201505
We suspect this will eventually lead to EU controls on all angling and we will vociferously oppose this threat.,110,51951,201505
"We will ensure sea anglers and our under 10-metre boat fleet are represented on the Marine Management Organisation, which licenses, regulates and plans marine activities in the seas around England and Wales.",406,51951,201505
"At present, none of the fifteen board members are fishermen.",406,51951,201505
The EU is just not interested in sustainable fishing.,110,51951,201505
"If we want to eat fish in  the future, we must preserve our fishing industry and our marine ecology.",406,51951,201505
We can only do this if we escape the CFP and introduce our own sustainable fishing practice.,406,51951,201505
“UKIP is the only party that actively works to protect our green and pleasant land from the threat of over-development and secure our historic buildings for future generations.,501,51951,201505
We will also fight to save the great British pub.”,502,51951,201505
"Our historic market towns, cathedral cities and unspoilt countryside are the envy of the world.",501,51951,201505
"From our Norman castles to Battersea Power Station, our heritage is an important part of our vibrant tourist industry, which supports three million jobs and contributes £127 billion annually to our economy.",502,51951,201505
‘Heritage’ was a dirty word in Labour’s ‘Cool Britannia.’,502,51951,201505
"Tony Blair moved the Department of National Heritage into the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and marginalised tourism by lumping it in with the responsibilities of the Minister for Sports and Equalities.",502,51951,201505
The Conservatives’ bulldozer instincts kicked in when the Chancellor removed the zero rate of VAT on listed building repairs.,502,51951,201505
"Maintenance bills for over 400,000 of our most beautiful buildings, owned by a surprisingly diverse socioeconomic group of people, were hiked by 20 per cent.",502,51951,201505
"Developers putting identikit houses on greenbelt land, meanwhile, paid no VAT.",416,51951,201505
UKIP will end this discrimination against our historic legacy by: -,502,51951,201505
"Creating a dedicated Minister of State for Heritage and Tourism, attached to the Cabinet Office",502,51951,201505
Ensuring tax and planning policies support historic buildings and the countryside,502,51951,201505
Removing VAT completely from repairs to listed building,502,51951,201505
Introducing a ‘presumption in favour of conservation’ as opposed to the current ‘presumption in favour of development’ in planning legislation.,502,51951,201505
"Too many seaside destinations face pressing economic, social and housing issues.",501,51951,201505
"Old former large hotels that once sat grandly on our seafront have become houses of multiple occupation, or low-cost hostels.",416,51951,201505
"The result, ‘bedsit land,’ deters families, young professionals and retired people from moving to the area and deters business investment.",416,51951,201505
"UKIP will fuel regeneration in coastal areas, transforming them into vibrant, growing communities by bestowing ‘Seaside Town Status’ to areas in need of regeneration.",402,51951,201505
This will give Local Authorities the power to:,301,51951,201505
Access low-interest government loans to buy up and renovate poor housing stock and convert empty commercial properties into residential accommodation,402,51951,201505
Issue Compulsory Purchase Order powers for poor-quality multi-occupancy accommodation,403,51951,201505
Allow local authorities to introduce minimum standards for properties in receipt of housing benefit,403,51951,201505
Restructure local housing markets so they are not excessively driven by profits from housing benefit income,403,51951,201505
Refuse housing benefit payments to landlords in breach of planning legislation.,403,51951,201505
We will boost the Coastal Communities Fund and expand its remit to:,403,51951,201505
"End the ‘scattergun’ approach, which sees funding allocated according to income from a particular area, rather than supporting nationwide regeneration",403,51951,201505
"Prioritise larger-scale heritage, residential, retail and tourist regeneration over smaller scale projects",502,51951,201505
Encourage regenerative arts projects into our coastal towns.,502,51951,201505
We are very proud of our ‘Save the Pub’ Campaign!,402,51951,201505
"The UK has lost 21,000 pubs since 1980, mostly as a result of taxation, regulation, the recent decline in disposable incomes and long-term cultural changes.",402,51951,201505
"The smoking ban and the alcohol duty escalator are estimated to be responsible for some 6,000 pub closures.",402,51951,201505
To reverse this trend we will: Offer tax breaks to smaller breweries to encourage micro-breweries,402,51951,201505
Keep the current excise duty scheme that exempts from duty cider and perry made by small domestic producers,402,51951,201505
Amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open smoking rooms provided they are properly ventilated and physically separated from nonsmoking areas.,402,51951,201505
Workers must not be required to enter smoking areas except for cleaning and other essential purposes when they are not in use,701,51951,201505
Oppose minimum pricing of alcohol and reverse plain paper packaging legislation for tobacco products.,401,51951,201505
"“Cuts to the police force,",605,51951,201505
"a plethora of insidious EU directives,",110,51951,201505
poor judgements from the European Court of Justice that trample on the rights of victims:,110,51951,201505
all these have eroded trust and confidence in policing and our judicial and prison systems.,605,51951,201505
Our internal national security has never felt so undermined.”,605,51951,201505
Since 2010 our internal national security has been weakened again and again.,605,51951,201505
"It is UKIP’s intention to draw a line under the cuts suffered by our police, prison and criminal justice services and provide them with adequate resources.",605,51951,201505
"We must get our law enforcement agencies back into a fit state, so they can deliver the protection British citizens have set great store by in the past and which we have a right to expect in the future.",601,51951,201505
"In addition to boosting the Border Agency by 2,500",605,51951,201505
"we will also put 3,500 more front line personnel into the police and prison services.",605,51951,201505
Our membership of the European Union and associated acceptance of the ‘free movement of people’ principle means we are unable to prevent criminals arriving on our shores.,110,51951,201505
"Truly horrific, tragic crimes have been committed in Britain by foreign criminals with long records in their home countries and petty criminality has risen as gangs of thieves, pickpockets and scammers have arrived from overseas to target the UK.",110,51951,201505
We must leave the EU to prevent those with criminal convictions coming here.,110,51951,201505
"By opening the borders to convicted criminals, previous governments have put us at unacceptable risk.",110,51951,201505
We have been badly let down.,110,51951,201505
"UKIP will do its utmost to deport foreign criminals and prevent those with criminal records from entering Britain, when we leave the EU.",110,51951,201505
"This will help protect our nation, free up prison places and relieve some of the stress on the prison service.",110,51951,201505
"Putting responsibility for law and order back into the hands of Parliament is key to UKIP’s approach to law and order, justice and internal security across the British Isles.",601,51951,201505
We will remove ourselves from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights: the Strasbourg Court whose interpretation of the European Convention of Human Rights has been known to put the rights of criminals above those of victims.,110,51951,201505
Our own Supreme Court will act as the final authority on matters of Human Rights.,601,51951,201505
We will also repeal Labour’s Human Rights legislation.,110,51951,201505
It has given European judges far too much power over British law making and law enforcement,110,51951,201505
and prevented us deporting terrorists and career criminals,110,51951,201505
and from implementing whole-life sentences.,110,51951,201505
"Our human rights will be enshrined in law via the introduction of a new, consolidated UK Bill of Rights.",201,51951,201505

"This new UK Bill of Rights will apply across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",201,51951,201505
UKIP will fully uphold the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty.’,601,51951,201505
This tenet of law is fundamental to British justice,601,51951,201505
"and UKIP will reverse the opt-in to EU law and justice measures, which disregard this fundamental principle, including the European Arrest Warrant and European Investigation Orders, which were enacted by the Coalition partners and supported by Labour.",110,51951,201505
"Austerity cuts have forced cuts to policing numbers that have gone too far, placing citizen safety and trust in policing at severe risk.",605,51951,201505
UKIP is committed to returning to a meaningful capita population-based policing resource.,605,51951,201505
Serving officers should not be subjected to undue stress as a result of being over-stretched.,605,51951,201505
Crime is not a ‘lifestyle option’ UKIP will tolerate.,605,51951,201505
"The more visible police we have on our streets, the more criminals are reminded of this fact and the more the public are reassured.",605,51951,201505
Reducing the numbers of territorial constabularies nationwide will release finance onto the front line:,605,51951,201505
"we  question whether 43 constabularies, each with a multiplicity and duplication of roles, is either a viable situation  or one suited to delivering operational efficiency.",605,51951,201505
"This will not be a ‘top-down’ process however, but an expert,  police-led approach, leading to collaboration and co-operation between constabularies and policing bodies  with the aim of producing structures more relevant to policing in 21st century Britain.",605,51951,201505
We will also reduce the number of Police and Crime Commissioners in line with our objective of a reduction in the number of territorial constabularies to save money and tackle serious crime.,605,51951,201505
The PCC role and remit will be reviewed before the next set of PCC elections to identify ´Best Practice´ that has been achieved across the country.,605,51951,201505
The findings of this exercise will be used to establish a new Terms of Reference and role specification for the remaining PCCs to ensure that they are ´fit for purpose´ regarding the identified challenges for policing and the criminal justice system as a whole.,605,51951,201505
We will also: Commit to keeping sworn and warranted officers under the service of the Crown.,605,51951,201505
UKIP will not outsource or privatise UK policing,605,51951,201505
Refuse to allow the introduction or deployment of the Euro Gendarmerie force within the UK,110,51951,201505
Invest in new technology such as communications equipment and personal CCTV to combat crime,605,51951,201505

"UKIP believes it is time for a review of what is and what is not a criminal offence and we will commit to such a review,",605,51951,201505
together with a review of commensurate sentencing policy to address the changing nature of crime today.,605,51951,201505
"The emphasis of such a review is likely to be on up to date sentencing procedures and processes for internet/cyber crime, sexual crime relating to minors, fraud, aggression, intimidation, people trafficking and gang masters and drug & substance abuse.",605,51951,201505
"Our overall approach to crime is one of firmness, coupled with deterrent and rehabilitative strategies and a focus on combatting crime that delivers clear social value outcomes.",605,51951,201505
We are also clear that the interests of law-abiding citizens and victims must always take precedence over those of criminals.,605,51951,201505
We also pledge the following: We will prosecute all cases of adult sexual behaviour with under-age minors.,605,51951,201505
The age of consent will not be reviewed or changed,603,51951,201505
We will adopt a zero tolerance approach to cultural practices that are either illegal,605,51951,201505
"or which conflict with British values and customs, including forced marriages, female genital mutilation and ‘so-called’ honour killings.",601,51951,201505
We will enforce the law and prosecute where necessary,605,51951,201505

"We will update licensing laws in response to calls from local authorities to limit the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 down to £2, to tackle problem gambling and anti-social behaviour.",605,51951,201505
We will decriminalise one crime: non-payment of the TV licence fee.,303,51951,201505
This will become a civil rather than a criminal offence.,303,51951,201505
We will also review the cost of the licence fee with a view to its reduction.,303,51951,201505
An early priority for UKIP will be to re-establish prison capacity.,605,51951,201505
We will not risk allowing sentencing or parole hearings to be influenced by a lack of prison places.,605,51951,201505
"In the first instance, we will free up prison space by removing foreign criminals, of which there were over 10,000 in prisons in England and Wales, according to the last reported figures from the House of Commons Library.",601,51951,201505

"If criminals do the crime, they can expect to serve the time.",605,51951,201505
"Rehabilitation and reintegration into society for all prisoners is a UKIP priority, so it is essential that prisoners have sufficient numeracy and literacy skills to re-enter the workplace.",605,51951,201505
We will introduce a system whereby suitably qualified prisoners will be paid to teach prisoners with a low standard of literacy and numeracy.,605,51951,201505
Prisoners must sign an education covenant requiring them to complete their studies on release.,605,51951,201505
Any money earned in prison must first be used to pay any compensation due to victims and thereafter towards further studies.,605,51951,201505
Prisoners will not be given the vote.,605,51951,201505
Those who have lost their right to liberty by committing a serious crime should also lose their ability to vote.,605,51951,201505
"Voting is a civic right, not a human right.",605,51951,201505
There is significant public concern about the ability of convicted foreign criminals first to gain entry to the UK and subsequently to obtain British citizenship.,601,51951,201505
UKIP will not allow this to continue.,601,51951,201505
"If they have been convicted of any crime, foreign nationals will potentially forfeit any entitlement to a UK Passport and to unrestricted entry to the country.",601,51951,201505

"They must also pay their own costs, or their home nation must fund their case.",601,51951,201505
This policy will benefit the UK tax payer;,601,51951,201505
is fair to all criminals regardless of origin;,503,51951,201505
and reinstates UK judicial control.,601,51951,201505
DNA testing and retention of DNA data results will be reinstated for all convicted foreign criminals.,601,51951,201505
"This, in our view, is a major preventative step towards protecting UK citizens and our front-line security forces.",601,51951,201505
We will amend the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 to enable the police to continue to keep samples from foreign suspects who are arrested but not charged in Britain.,601,51951,201505

"The outcome of these referendums will be included in the Queen’s Speech, therefore allowing the public to directly influence legislation.",202,51951,201505
"We will also pledge to put matters gathering over 100,000 signatures on the Commons’ Order Paper, to make sure they are genuinely debated and voted upon, not simply brushed over, as currently happens",202,51951,201505
The Right of Recall: UKIP will give voters real power to sack their MP and scrap the bogus Recall measures introduced by the Tory-led Coalition.,202,51951,201505
"Under our proposals, if twenty per cent of an MP’s constituents demand it, within a period of eight weeks, a Recall ballot will be triggered.",202,51951,201505
"We will extend this Right of Recall to all elected politicians, e.g. councillors",202,51951,201505
An Open Primaries Bill: UKIP will introduce an Open Primaries Bill to enable any political parties that wished to do so to widen their selection process to include every local voter.,204,51951,201505
Open Primary ballots would help ensure candidates in winnable seats need not be Westminster insiders.,202,51951,201505
"As well as making MPs more accountable to the public, UKIP will make Government answer more directly to Parliament.",202,51951,201505
"These will require Commons Select Committees to vote to approve the appointment of any new minister, senior civil servant or senior diplomat before they get the job.",202,51951,201505

"The Army is tasked with reducing personnel numbers to 82,000 by 2018, down from 102,500 in 2010.",104,51951,201505
Battle tank strength has been cut by 40 per cent and there has been a 35 per cent cut in self-propelled artillery.,104,51951,201505
"The Conservatives’ ambition to recruit 30,000 personnel to the Territorial Army is failing.",104,51951,201505
"Together, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy have suffered more than 10,000 job losses.",104,51951,201505
The Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft programme has been cancelled.,104,51951,201505
"The aircraft carrier fleet has been decommissioned, despite having no operational replacements available until 2020.",104,51951,201505
These cuts have demoralised our Armed Forces and left the nation unprepared to face emerging threats.,104,51951,201505
Our current level of military spending and staffing is not fulfilling the terms of our NATO membership - which requires that we spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence -,104,51951,201505
and the government has failed to lay out details of spending plans beyond 2015/16.,104,51951,201505
"On the basis that the current base level of defence spending is maintained after 2015/16 at 1.9 per cent, UKIP will increase the defence budget to meet our obligations to NATO and spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence in 2015/16.",104,51951,201505
We will exceed it substantially for the remaining years of the parliament.,104,51951,201505
We will phase in increased defence spending over the next five years up to an additional £4 billion by 2020.,104,51951,201505
"This will return funding to the pre-SDSR level, and allow for £1 billion yearly expenditure on capital projects deemed to be of the highest strategic priority by the MoD.",104,51951,201505
"We will rebuild our Armed Forces and restore them to their rightful place among the most professional, flexible and effective fighting forces in the world, able to meet the security demands of the modern era and react appropriately to any threat that the UK faces both now and in the future.",104,51951,201505
"Faced with rogue states such as North Korea and Iran, which have developed advanced nuclear capabilities, UKIP does not believe now is the time to be talking about or proposing nuclear disarmament and we support Trident renewal.",104,51951,201505
The two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are superb operational platforms.,104,51951,201505
"UKIP supports their deployment, while having reservations about the Royal Navy’s ability to man, operate and protect them:",104,51951,201505
it could take nearly every ship in the current fleet to form an effective carrier group.,104,51951,201505
"We also have reservations about the development of the American F-35B Lightning II aircraft that are due to fly from the carriers by 2020, given the massive technical problems involved.",104,51951,201505
This platform may never be mission-capable.,104,51951,201505
We will investigate further whether it would be better to commission an ‘off-the-shelf’ aircraft option and adapt the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers for non-vertical take-off and landings.,104,51951,201505
"Currently, British intelligence is fragmented between a number of agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and BBC Monitoring.",104,51951,201505
All have different funding streams and report to different government departments.,104,51951,201505
This generates a significant overlap in work and resources and risks exposing gaps in the system.,104,51951,201505
"UKIP will create a new over-arching role of Director of National Intelligence (subject to confirmation hearing by the relevant Commons Select Committee), who will be charged with reviewing UK intelligence and security, in order to ensure threats are identified, monitored and dealt with by the swiftest, most appropriate and legal means available.",104,51951,201505
He or she will be responsible for bringing all intelligence services together; developing cyber security measures; cutting down on waste and encouraging information and resource sharing.,104,51951,201505
UKIP will revise the Armed Forces terms of service to ensure personnel on operational duty overseas do not pay income tax.,104,51951,201505
UKIP wholly opposes the creation of a EU Army.,110,51951,201505
"We will not tolerate British troops operating under European command, on British soil or elsewhere.",110,51951,201505
"Wherever we send our brave heroes, whatever the danger, they never let us down.",104,51951,201505
We will not let them down.,104,51951,201505
We will honour the Military Covenant.,104,51951,201505
"UKIP will create a dedicated Minister for Veterans, attached to the Cabinet Office to head up a Veterans Administration (VA).",104,51951,201505
The VA will work with current MoD veteran services and established charities to provide a single point of contact for veterans in a range of fields:,104,51951,201505
"health care, housing, counselling, education and training, rehabilitation, hospital care, access to veteran financial services, benefits and memorialisation.",104,51951,201505
"Issues such as veteran homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems will also come under this remit, as will rolling out the following initiatives by 2020:",104,51951,201505
"We believe members of our Armed Forces should have access to expert care services, configured to meet the specific needs of serving forces personnel and veterans.",104,51951,201505
"Britain is the only major country in Europe that does not have a dedicated military hospital, so we will build one.",104,51951,201505
It will provide specialist physical and mental health services and provide accommodation for 150 relatives or friends on site.,104,51951,201505
"9,000 homeless people are ex-forces, as are one in ten people sleeping rough on the streets, according to charities Combat Stress and Crisis.",104,51951,201505
That those who have been willing to defend our homeland have ended up without a home themselves is appalling.,104,51951,201505
"By 2020, UKIP will build eight halfway house veterans’ hostels, each with 200 rooms and modelled on similar hostels already in operation.",104,51951,201505
We will also built 500 affordable rent homes every year for ex-forces personnel.,104,51951,201505
"We will guarantee the offer of a job in the police service, prison service or border force for anyone who has served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years.",104,51951,201505
"This policy will also help meet our pledge to fund an additional 6,000 full time positions across these three organisations.",104,51951,201505
"We will secure our borders, get more police on the streets, have safer prisons and honour the Military Covenant.",104,51951,201505
Skills gained in the forces can be useful when running a small business.,104,51951,201505
"We will create a ‘Boots to Business’ scheme to channel loans, grants and access to free professional advice and mentors to veterans who wish to set up and run their own businesses after leaving the forces.",104,51951,201505
Key roles for the VA will include bereavement support;,104,51951,201505
the issue of a veteran service card to ensure fast-track access to NHS mental health care;,104,51951,201505
"and the award of a National Defence Medal to all veterans, irrespective of rank or length of service.",104,51951,201505
"The current anomaly in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme will be rectified, so no veteran has to use their war pension to pay for social care, whenever they were injured.",104,51951,201505
These entitlements will be extended to service personnel from overseas.,104,51951,201505
"If they have shared the responsibility, stress and danger associated with military service, they should be entitled to exactly the same benefits as the man or woman who stood at their side.",104,51951,201505
“Britain’s role in the world has changed significantly over the past few decades.,105,51951,201505
"Instead of concerning ourselves with securing peace, British forces have been deployed around the world in a series of conflicts that seem to have worsened, instead of improved, our security situation.”",105,51951,201505
"Since 1997, Labour and the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition have deployed our Armed Forced to conflicts in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Libya and Iraq, while maintaining the ‘War on Terror’.",105,51951,201505
They proposed military action in Syria.,105,51951,201505
"Latest deployments include deterrent exercises in Poland and the Baltic States and a little publicised, but substantial, deployment to Nigeria.",105,51951,201505
These interventions have stretched the UK’s Armed Forces to the limit and damaged our reputation in the international community.,105,51951,201505
They have caused social problems here at home,105,51951,201505
and jaded the British public’s attitude towards involvement in future conflicts.,105,51951,201505
Iraq is a much more dangerous place today.,105,51951,201505
So is Libya,105,51951,201505
"Britain’s increasing involvement with European Union expansionism is putting us increasingly, unnecessarily, at loggerheads with Russia.",110,51951,201505
The MoD recently told Ukraine it can count on ‘any possible assistance’ in maintaining its territorial integrity.,105,51951,201505
It is yet another sign that our political leaders are willing to put our troops in harm’s way at the behest of other country’s political agendas.,105,51951,201505
"We have to be clear: we should stand firmly alongside our allies around the world,",107,51951,201505
but cannot continue committing troops into conflict at the drop of a hat – often under-resourced -,105,51951,201505
and with a veterans policy that lets down those returning from the horrors of war.,105,51951,201505
"Our commitment to NATO must be upheld and we will not shirk our responsibilities towards our allies,",104,51951,201505
"but UKIP believes our parliamentary democracy should be consulted at every opportunity, before committing any taxpayer resources, or our forces, to combat situations.",202,51951,201505
"UKIP acknowledges there are real, existential threats around the world.",104,51951,201505
"The rise of Islamic extremism is at the forefront of this and, indeed, is possibly the most important battle of our generation.",104,51951,201505
"But the fight with and against this ideology is not best fought on a battlefield 3,000 miles away,",105,51951,201505
"but at home, where we have significant problems of radicalisation and incitement to terrorism",605,51951,201505
"In Europe, UKIP would push for commitments from our European neighbours, as well as multi-national organisations, to guarantee the British sovereignty and territorial integrity of Gibraltar and its waters.",109,51951,201505
"In the South Atlantic, we must not ‘negotiate’ or kowtow to Argentine aggression over the Falkland Islands, but uphold and respect the islanders’ decision – through the self-determination of a recent referendum – their overwhelming desire and right to remain British.",109,51951,201505
"In the Middle East, UKIP wants to see nations at peace,",106,51951,201505
"but acknowledges that sectarianism, fuelled by historical Western involvement, has rendered this all but impossible within a generation.",105,51951,201505
"We want to see a peaceful, two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories.",106,51951,201505
"Britain is not merely a European country, but part of a global community, the Anglosphere.",107,51951,201505
"Beyond the EU and even the Commonwealth are a network of nations that share not merely our language but our common law, democratic traditions and global trading interests.",107,51951,201505
"From India to the United States, New Zealand to the Caribbean, UKIP would want to foster closer ties with the Anglosphere.",107,51951,201505
"Around the rest of the globe, UKIP’s policies, including opening up from a small, Euro-centric view of the world – wherein we are bound by EU membership not to negotiate our own trade deals- to becoming a sovereign nation that can trade with other countries, would once again inform our foreign policy.",110,51951,201505
"Once unbound from the EU, Britain would once again take her place in the family of nations as an independent, sovereign state, free to negotiate her own trade deals and determine her own foreign policy objectives.",109,51951,201505
"We believe nations which trade with one another are less likely to go to war with each other and, it is on this basis, that we would seek to create a more global Britain, fully able to pursue her own interests.",109,51951,201505
"“Ultimately, UKIP wants to help lift people out of poverty through trade, not aid.",107,51951,201505
"In the meantime, we’ll continue to support the poorest people on earth through programmes that prioritise clean water and sanitation, vaccinations and disaster relief.”",107,51951,201505
The politics of austerity has taken its toll.,503,51951,201505
Hundreds of thousands of people in Britain are relying on foodbanks for survival.,503,51951,201505
`Pensioners are freezing to death in winter as a result of rising fuel bills.,503,51951,201505
The NHS is under severe financial strain.,504,51951,201505
"Social care budgets have been slashed, leaving some of the most needy in our society without adequate support.",503,51951,201505
Our young people have been forced into debt by a 200 per cent increase in tuition fees.,503,51951,201505
"Despite this severe economic hardship, MPs and peers in all parties except UKIP voted to massively increase foreign aid expenditure, borrowing money that will increase the national debt we leave to our children.",109,51951,201505
It is now enshrined in law that we must pay 0.7 per cent of our Gross National Income (GNI) on aid every year.,109,51951,201505
"The old parties pushed ahead with this expenditure regardless, ignoring considerable evidence that the money spent on overseas aid is not well directed or controlled and that much is wasted, lost to corruption or handed to countries already wealthy enough to have their own space programmes, nuclear weapons and even overseas aid programmes of their own.",109,51951,201505
UKIP will repeal recent legislation committing aid spending to 0.7 per cent of GNI.,109,51951,201505
We object to taxpayers’ money being sent to already economically thriving countries;,109,51951,201505
countries with poor human rights’ records;,201,51951,201505
and to money being spent on politically correct vanity projects that do nothing to lift developing nations out of poverty.,109,51951,201505
We also believe charity should begin at home.,109,51951,201505
"UKIP will bring overseas aid spending into line with that of the United States, which has a very similar level of deficit and overall debt as a percentage of GNI to the UK.",109,51951,201505
USA aid currently stands at 0.2 per cent of GNI and this is what we will match.,109,51951,201505
"This change will be phased in over three years and the UK level of overseas aid will remain substantial, not falling below £4 billion per annum, more than given by Spain and Italy combined.",109,51951,201505
Projects in progress will be completed and any contractual obligations met.,107,51951,201505
"We will require all project expenditure to have clear, definable outcomes and future spending priorities will focus on emergency relief, healthcare, inoculation against preventable diseases and clean water and sanitation programmes.",107,51951,201505
"The contracts for delivery of these programmes will be offered to British providers first, following removal of the EU Procurement Directive.",110,51951,201505
"Removing barriers to trade is a far more effective way to tackle poverty than giving aid hand-outs, which can provide incentives for corrupt leaders to stifle economic progress.",401,51951,201505
"This is where UKIP will focus: having escaped from the EU’s protectionism, which has a negative impact on international development,",110,51951,201505
"we will be better placed to help provide sustainable livelihoods for the world’s poorest people, by giving them free access to the British market.",401,51951,201505
"DFID has already shown itself to be wasteful and lacking in focus on aid outcomes, yet its budget has been protected from recent government cuts.",303,51951,201505
"UKIP takes a very different view: when DFID’s budget is reduced, we see no reason to keep DIFD running as an independent Government department.",303,51951,201505
"We will close DFID and merge its essential functions into the Foreign Office, retaining a single Minister for Overseas Development.",303,51951,201505
UKIP’s position has been quite unfairly and misleadingly labelled ‘anti-Europe.’,110,51951,201505
"We are not ‘anti-Europe,’ but we are firmly opposed to political integration within Europe.",110,51951,201505
"Back in 1972, we were told we were joining a ‘common market.’",110,51951,201505
What we actually joined was a supranational political union.,110,51951,201505
"We have lost our rights of self-government in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe, which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, a vast civil service, and fledgling military and police forces.",110,51951,201505
The tentacles of the EU stretch into almost every area of our national life.,110,51951,201505
"The EU has complete control over British financial services, fishing, farming, energy and trade.",110,51951,201505
It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules.,110,51951,201505
"It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services, our foreign affairs and tax policy.",110,51951,201505
There is significant momentum behind plans for a EU-wide army and police force.,110,51951,201505
"The EU ‘shares’ responsibility with us for many other policy areas, including animal welfare, consumer protection, public health, space programmes, social policy, humanitarian aid and vocational training, to mention but a few.",110,51951,201505
"On these and many other issues, our elected Westminster politicians are impotent.",110,51951,201505
"They pretend to have the power to influence these matters, but actually they have none.",110,51951,201505
"It is an out-of-sight, unaccountable, pan-European bureaucratic elite which has the final say and they do not consider Britain’s best interests.",110,51951,201505
The European Parliament is no safeguard.,110,51951,201505
It is a sham democracy: our MEPs are not allowed to generate or re-visit existing legislation.,110,51951,201505
"They can only vote on decisions made by unelected Commissioners and, even then, their vote can be ignored.",110,51951,201505
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by leaving the EU.,110,51951,201505
"Despite the fact we are the world’s fifth largest economy and the seventh largest manufacturing nation, we will never again make a direct trade deal with any other nation until we leave the EU.",110,51951,201505
We will never control our borders or manage immigration.,110,51951,201505
We will never be able to prevent foreign trawlers plundering our seas of precious fish.,110,51951,201505
"If the EU’s plans for ‘tax harmonisation’ come to fruition, soon we may find we cannot even set our own taxes.",110,51951,201505
What else is coming down the tracks?,110,51951,201505
"A British exit from the EU, ‘Brexit,’ is the only choice open to us, if we are to make our own laws and control our own destiny.",110,51951,201505
"Unless we leave, our democracy, our law-making powers and our sovereignty will continue to be salami-sliced away by the EU.",110,51951,201505
"Genuine reform is impossible: successive EU Presidents, senior officials and European Prime Ministers have confirmed there is no hope of Britain negotiating any opt-outs, or special treatment.",110,51951,201505
"As far as our ‘influence’ goes, we have very little anyway.",110,51951,201505
"As the European Union has expanded, our vote share in the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission, has declined to the point where it is now almost insignificant.",110,51951,201505
"We can vote ‘no’ to proposals as often as we like, but unless other countries agree, measures will go on become British law anyway.",110,51951,201505
"For all these reasons and more, Britain is better off out.",110,51951,201505
This is our roadmap to freedom: the process that will lead Great Britain out of the EU and into the world.,110,51951,201505
UKIP believes British citizens should have an in/out referendum on our membership of the EU as soon as possible.,110,51951,201505
Our question of choice will be:,110,51951,201505
"Only British citizens will be allowed to vote and there will be strict spending limits for both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ camps, together with fair, balanced and equal media coverage of both arguments.",110,51951,201505
"Following a vote to leave, we have two legal options:",110,51951,201505
We repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and leave immediately,110,51951,201505
We activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and notify the European Council that the UK has decided to leave the EU in two years’ time.,110,51951,201505
"The second option provides for a sensible, orderly exit and this is the option we prefer.",110,51951,201505
"Having activated Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, we will set a fixed date, two years ahead, on which we intend to leave, while recognising we could leave earlier.",110,51951,201505
Then we will begin amicable negotiations.,110,51951,201505
"British exit will be a huge relief for many other EU members, who have known all along that the vast majority of the British people find the idea of political union with the rest of Europe abhorrent.",110,51951,201505
"They are fully aware that we would never have joined the EU, had the political nature of the enterprise not been deliberately concealed from the electorate in 1975.",110,51951,201505
"Our leaving will set them free to have full political union, if that is what they really want",110,51951,201505
"and set us free to make the most of all our links with the Commonwealth,",101,51951,201505
"with North America,",101,51951,201505
"Australasia, much of Africa, the Indian subcontinent and all the other countries where English is the first or second language, as well as, of course, with Europe and the EU itself.",107,51951,201505

"and, militarily, the strongest European member of NATO.",104,51951,201505
"With Russia once more flexing its muscles and controlling much of the energy supplies to Western Europe, the other EU member states will have more than a casual interest in making sure their relationship with us remains amicable.",107,51951,201505
What do we wish to achieve from our negotiations with the EU?,407,51951,201505
"Our objectives are clear: Firstly, we will secure trade agreements with the EU, the 40 nations with trade agreements with the EU and other nations of interest to us.",407,51951,201505
"As a G7 member, a leading world economy, the fifth largest by GDP, this will be a rapid process in most cases.",407,51951,201505
Countries already trading with the EU will want to continue seamless trade relationships;,407,51951,201505
other world nations will want to forge new trade alliances with the UK;,407,51951,201505
and all nations will find it easier to deal with the UK directly.,407,51951,201505
"As a minimum, we will seek continued access on free-trade terms to the EU’s single market.",407,51951,201505
Our custom is valuable to the EU now and will continue to be so following Brexit.,407,51951,201505
"Secondly, there will be a wide range of issues on which we will want to continue to co-operate.",108,51951,201505
"These include extradition treaties,",108,51951,201505

The Green Party believes that the Irish economy must develop its indigenous base,406,53110,200705
and that tax reliefs,402,53110,200705

"At present, a decision to rezone land can generate large sums of money for the landowner.",0,53110,200705
"At the same time, local authorities",0,53110,200705

The Green Party will change this.,305,53110,200705
"replace commercial rates with an annual Site Value Tax on all land, except primary homes, agricultural land and State property that is used for non-administrative purposes, based on the value that a particular piece of land would have if there were no buildings or improvements on it;",416,53110,200705

"Under the Kyoto Protocol, the taxpayer will pay over €500m for carbon credits between 2008 and 2012,",416,53110,200705

Ireland is exceptional within the EU for the high proportion of social spending that is means-tested,504,53110,200705
- just over a quarter.,504,53110,200705
An integrated taxation and social welfare system,303,53110,200705

Increasing the number of Community Gardaí to 1500,605,53320,200705
Providing one year of free pre-school education for every child,504,53320,200705
Abolition of the means test for carers,504,53320,200705
Establishing a ‘Begin to Buy’ scheme to allow people who are working to buy a stake in a home.,402,53320,200705
These spending commitments represent a modest proportion of the total amount of resources that are likely to be available over the next five years.,0,53320,200705
"Allocation of additional resources for further public service improvements will be determined in the context of annual budgetary planning,",504,53320,200705
subject to our overriding commitment to economic stability and our EMU obligations.,414,53320,200705
The tax and spending commitments given in this manifesto are subject to the over-riding requirement for fiscal stability as expressed by the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.,414,53320,200705
We are committed to increasing Ireland’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) to meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.,107,53320,200705
"Accordingly, we will legislate to establish an ODA fund, into which 0.7 per cent of GNP will paid annually (in a manner similar to the payments to the NPRF).",107,53320,200705
"In this way, ODA contributions will be accounted for as a charge on the Central Fund.",107,53320,200705
"We will fulfil existing government policy commitments across a range of public services areas,",405,53320,200705
"including those set out in the Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.",0,53320,200705
"In order to address a range of economic and social infrastructural deficits,",411,53320,200705
"and to lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, Ireland will be required to maintain a high level of capital spending over the next decade.",411,53320,200705
Labour will increase capital spending to the levels set out in the National Development Plan.,411,53320,200705
"At the same time we will introduce a new framework for delivering infrastructure on time and on budget, as set out elsewhere in this manifesto.",411,53320,200705
We will also invest 1 per cent of GNP in the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) annually over the lifetime of the government.,504,53320,200705
Poor management of public expenditure has diminished confidence in public services as a means of delivering a better quality of life and a more equal society.,304,53320,200705
"As a party committed to the concept of high quality public services, Labour has already published detailed proposals for delivering better value for money in our document entitled The Buck Stops Here.",303,53320,200705
"This set out more than forty specific recommendations to improve strategic management of government priorities,",303,53320,200705
"enhance Oireachtas scrutiny of spending, modernise the expenditure management capacity of the civil and public service,",303,53320,200705
and set out clear lines of accountability for Ministers and civil servants.,303,53320,200705
These proposals are set out in detail elsewhere in this manifesto in the section entitled ‘Reinventing government’,0,53320,200705
"Over the term of office of the next government, economic growth will generate substantial exchequer resources.",0,53320,200705
"In that context, Labour will implement the following progressive tax reforms:",402,53320,200705
Labour will enhance the incomes of hard working families who have suffered from the “rip off” experience by delivering  progressive income tax reform.,503,53320,200705
"We will also provide income tax reforms that recognise the work done by carers in the home,",503,53320,200705
"and which support the life choices of all families, including parents and other carers, in achieving their own preferred balance between paid work and unpaid care.",705,53320,200705
A 2-point cut in the standard rate of tax from 20 per cent to 18 per cent.,402,53320,200705
An increase in personal credits in line with wage growth.,402,53320,200705
"This will increase the personal and married credits to €2,000 and €4,000 respectively by 2012.",402,53320,200705
"Combined with a cut in the standard rate of tax, the increase in personal tax credits will ensure that no employee earning less than €10.30 per hour (€400 per week assuming a 39 hour week; €20,900 per year) will pay income tax.",402,53320,200705
"An increase in the home-carers’ credit to the level of the PAYE credit (to €1,760), with a doubling of the income disregard for eligibility for this credit to €10,160.",402,53320,200705
"Indexation of the standard rate band to wage increases on an annual basis, in a way that provides the same increase for one and twoincome families.",503,53320,200705
"Wage indexation alone will increase the standard rate band by €6,000 for singles, and will increase the transferable band by €12,000 for one- and two-income families.",503,53320,200705
This will halt the present policy of continually widening the gap between the tax treatment of one-and two-income families.,503,53320,200705
"On top of indexation, we will provide an additional €5,000 increase in the transferable band for one-income and two-income families, to be offset by a cut in the extra standard rate band for the second earner from €25,000 to €20,000.",402,53320,200705
"It is the role of government to help families buy their homes, not to get in their way.",402,53320,200705
"The present stamp duty structure has become inequitable because of the failure of government to adjust tax thresholds as house prices rose, and because of the structure of the tax which applies each progressive rate to the whole house price not just to the excess above the previous threshold.",503,53320,200705
The result is high stamp duty payments on much more modest homes than was originally intended.,0,53320,200705
"In government, we will introduce a fairer system of stamp duty on residential properties that helps make housing for all families more affordable.",503,53320,200705
"Raise the zero stamp duty threshold for first time buyers from €317,500 to €450,000 with duty paid only on the excess over this threshold.",503,53320,200705
Restructure the stamp duty system for other buyers as follows:,503,53320,200705
"No stamp duty up to €100,000",402,53320,200705
"On the next €350,000 a 5 per cent rate will apply",402,53320,200705
On the balance a 9 per cent rate will apply,402,53320,200705
These changes will be a priority for Labour in government and will be introduced as a single measure.,0,53320,200705
"We recognise that a competitive tax regime has been, and will remain, vital in encouraging employment, entrepreneurship, investment and exports.",402,53320,200705
"We recognise the need to maintain incentives for work, and",402,53320,200705
to maintain Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for mobile investment and skilled labour.,402,53320,200705
Maintain the existing rates of Corporation Tax.,402,53320,200705
Maintain the existing rates of Capital Gains Tax.,402,53320,200705
Restrict growth in charges by state bodies at the rate of inflation.,412,53320,200705
Any requested increases beyond the rate of inflation will require a specific Public Interest Report to be presented to the Dáil.,412,53320,200705
"Examine further tax measures to make investment /in high-tech, export-oriented Irish firms more attractive to investors.",402,53320,200705
"Review the operation of the Tax Credit for Research and Development in Ireland / to see how it can be made more attractive to smaller, Irish-owned companies that are seeking to develop new products and services.",402,53320,200705
"As set out elsewhere in this manifesto, Labour is committed to comprehensive and urgent action to tackle climate change.",501,53320,200705
We will rebalance VRT in a revenue-neutral fashion to favour lower-emission vehicles.,416,53320,200705
"We will abolish excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable energy crops, in conjunction with other measures to stimulate the development of a market in biofuels.",416,53320,200705
We will introduce a stamp duty credit linked to a sustainability rating structure (reducing prices of energy efficient buildings in built up areas).,416,53320,200705
"Under Fianna Fáil and the PDs, the Irish tax system has been distorted to facilitate systematic avoidance of taxation by wealthier individuals in Irish society.",503,53320,200705
The spectacle of millionaires paying little or no tax is both profoundly unfair and corrosive of public confidence in the tax code.,503,53320,200705
"We will ensure that the tax system is administratively simpler, more transparent and fairer.",303,53320,200705
"■  We will establish a Commission on Taxation to examine tax schemes on an on-going basis, whose work will include:",303,53320,200705
Subjecting tax breaks to scrutiny of their costs and benefits.,303,53320,200705
Assessing compliance levels for different tax headings and revenue powers needed to protect the tax system; and,303,53320,200705
Presenting an evaluation of the tax burden and compliance costs for taxpayers.,303,53320,200705
"We will put in place a tax-payers advocate, situated in the National Consumer Agency, to ensure that PAYE workers in particular get all the tax credits to which they are entitled.",303,53320,200705
We will cap the benefit that any one individual can derive from cumulative tax breaks on investments outside of his/her principal occupation so that very wealthy individuals cannot use such schemes to avoid paying a reasonable share of their income in tax.,503,53320,200705
We will extend tax relief at source to additional areas such as bin charges and medical expenses.,504,53320,200705
We will provide for equal tax treatment for couples in Civil Unions.,705,53320,200705
The introduction of the decentralisation programme flew in the face of all established procedures for ensuring sound decision-making and the government's own National Spatial Strategy.,305,53320,200705
It threatens both to waste taxpayers’ money and damage public services.,305,53320,200705
There is a real danger that major property commitments have been entered into which will only offer partial service and create wasteful duplication.,305,53320,200705
It has also undermined morale and operating efficiency in the public service.,305,53320,200705
This approach has damaged the potential for a rational and coherent decentralisation programme based on consultation and fair procedures.,305,53320,200705
Labour proposes to create a framework where the best elements of the present decentralisation programme can be secured and further potential opportunities developed for the future.,301,53320,200705
An Immediate audit will be undertaken of the existing proposals.,303,53320,200705
"We shall proceed with those which have a sound business case, and a good regional fit.",301,53320,200705
Decentralisation should be voluntary and based on genuine consultation.,202,53320,200705
"Where the specific proposals are found wanting, we will seek to identify alternative opportunities for decentralisation which have the potential to succeed given a sensible and well planned timescale.",301,53320,200705
This must be part of a wider strategy for balanced regional development.,301,53320,200705
We will reverse the decision to move some of the core policy planning units of government departments away from Dublin city as it would undermine the continuing effectiveness of policy development.,302,53320,200705
It is our clear preference that ‘stand alone’ business units be moved under the decentralisation programme.,301,53320,200705
We are also opposed to the moving of specialist posts which results in the loss of vital expertise or wasteful duplication of posts.,302,53320,200705
We recognise the particular position of staff in state agencies.,302,53320,200705
Ireland’s past successes in attracting foreign investment are world-famous and a vital part of our present economic success.,407,53320,200705
"In the future, however, we cannot expect to repeat the industrial successes and policies of the past.",0,53320,200705
Ireland and the rest of the world have changed too much.,0,53320,200705
We must build a new model of growth based on the knowledge economy to create more and better jobs.,411,53320,200705
"Parts of China, India, South East Asia and Central Europe now compete for the types of high-tech manufacturing and services activities – electronics, software, financial services and pharmaceuticals – that drove the Celtic Tiger in the 1990s.",0,53320,200705
"Many have replicated Ireland’s favourable corporation tax regime, grant incentives and access to skills.",402,53320,200705
There is now a track record of high end manufacturing and services in these countries that were once regarded as being too underdeveloped for these activities.,0,53320,200705
"This trend is blurring the traditional differences between industrialised and developing countries,",0,53320,200705
"and intensifying competition for highpaid, knowledge-intensive jobs.",411,53320,200705
"At the same time, our own competitiveness and export performance has suffered from a governmentdriven inflationary boom that has dramatically raised costs,",414,53320,200705
led to the re-emergence of a large and growing external payments deficit,414,53320,200705
and made our economy far too dependent on construction and the public sector for jobs growth.,414,53320,200705
The government has simply not acted with expedition in addressing these issues.,305,53320,200705
"Rather, the sluggishness of government has been part of the problem.",305,53320,200705
"As the momentum to growth from construction and consumption eases off in the coming years, the main economic challenge facing the next government will be to recover our lost competitiveness",410,53320,200705
"and enter a more export-driven phase of growth,",410,53320,200705
built not just on low corporation tax,402,53320,200705
but on other advantages harder to imitate by lower wage economies.,411,53320,200705
"Ireland continues to have significant competitive advantages,",411,53320,200705
and the potential to create a new generation of indigenous enterprises,401,53320,200705
which are both high-tech and strongly export-orientated.,411,53320,200705
We must provide an environment that supports the creation and development of more Irish exporters,401,53320,200705
and encourages foreign investors to increase the strategic importance of their Irish operations through R&D and marketing.,411,53320,200705
"The total number of jobs created is important,",408,53320,200705
but so too is the quality of those jobs.,408,53320,200705
Ireland can only compete with lower wage locations on the basis of higher quality and productivity.,410,53320,200705
"While short-term cost competitiveness remains important,",410,53320,200705
it is vital that we build a platform of competitive advantage that will create and sustain higher quality jobs,408,53320,200705
– jobs that produce more and pay more.,408,53320,200705
Labour in government was central to the agreement of the 12.5 per cent single rate of corporation tax.,402,53320,200705
"As globalisation intensifies, a competitive tax regime for high-tech foreign direct investment and indigenous exporting companies alike is more vital now than ever before,",402,53320,200705
"even as we also develop other, less replicable, sources of competitive advantage.",410,53320,200705
"We also need to make sure our tax system is supportive of indigenous entrepreneurs and exporters,",402,53320,200705
which continue to report difficulties in raising risk capital.,401,53320,200705
Maintain the current rates of corporation tax and capital gains tax,402,53320,200705
Expand our tax treaty network with Asia and Latin America to maximise the benefit of our low rate of corporation tax,402,53320,200705
and to ensure that double taxation does not present a barrier to trade and investment with these fast developing economies.,402,53320,200705
"Examine further tax measures to make investment in high-tech, export oriented Irish firms more attractive to investors.",402,53320,200705
"By winding down property-based tax incentives, we will shift the balance away from the excessive, tax-driven allocation of savings in Ireland into property and towards more productive, export-oriented activities.",402,53320,200705
There is a need to create a more even playing field for those competing for investment funds.,408,53320,200705
Review the operation of the tax credit for research and development in Ireland to see how it can be made more attractive to smaller Irishowned companies that are seeking to develop new products and services.,402,53320,200705
Provide increased direct state support for the development of the Irish venture capital industry through Enterprise Ireland.,413,53320,200705
This support will also be used to stimulate increased support for the venture capital industry from the private sector.,408,53320,200705
"Examine the barriers to Irish growth companies seeking public stock exchange listings and share issues, the small scale of which is a barrier to the development of the venture capital industry in Ireland",410,53320,200705
and to the expansion of growth-oriented Irish companies.,410,53320,200705
"Economic and technological changes are creating demand for a rising threshold of basic skills,",411,53320,200705
as well as for more frequent changes in the nature of skills required.,411,53320,200705
The challenge facing Ireland and its workforce cannot be understated.,411,53320,200705
"According to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, of the 2.4 million people expected to be in the workforce by 2020, 1.43 million are already at work.",411,53320,200705
"Of the current workforce, 440,000 have at most lower secondary education, including 165,000 aged 35 or less.",411,53320,200705
"Participation by Irish adults in ongoing education and training remains, however, low compared with other countries.",411,53320,200705
"To meet this challenge, Ireland must develop a new attitude and approach to education and life-long learning.",411,53320,200705
"We must generate a Learning Community, as set out elsewhere in this manifesto.",411,53320,200705
"In terms of upskilling, we must set ourselves the target of increasing the number of people in employment that formally progress by at least one level under the National Framework of Qualifications by 100,000 over a fiveyear time frame.",411,53320,200705
"In policy terms, this requires a shift in the focus on national policy from just training people for employment to also training people in employment, reflecting our changed economic circumstances.",411,53320,200705
Abolish fees for part time undergraduate courses  for individuals who have not already benefited from higher education.,504,53320,200705
"Increase modularisation, portability and cross-recognition of courses taken in higher education institutions to facilitate part-time, flexible education and training.",411,53320,200705
"Accelerate the development of a national framework of qualifications that is well understood and recognised by individuals, employers and education and training providers and that makes access, transfer and progression a reality.",411,53320,200705
This requires the rapid development of a certification and accreditation system to ensure that work-place learning can be properly certified and recognised.,411,53320,200705
"Provide more educational and training progression routes for those working in construction, through completion of apprenticeships and through easier progression into other higher educational technical and business disciplines.",506,53320,200705
"Introduce an option to take two-weeks statutory annual paid training leave, financed out of the NTF and paid at the minimum wage rate in order to focus on the lowskilled.",411,53320,200705
This could be topped up by employers on a voluntary basis.,411,53320,200705
"Increase support for employer-led training networks, delivered through Skillnets and the enterprise development agencies.",411,53320,200705
Greater support will be provided for training networks that focus on transferable skills (ICT literacy etc.) for the low-skilled.,411,53320,200705
Re-invent the role of FÁS to achieve greater focus and efficiencies.,411,53320,200705
FÁS will be given a strong mandate to expand work-training schemes and apprenticeships and to empower individuals and small businesses to access relevant training.,411,53320,200705
Provide additional financial contributions from the Social Insurance Fund to support education and training for those that have been made redundant.,411,53320,200705
Ireland has the capacity to be a world leader in internet and information technology innovation.,411,53320,200705
"Yet due to ongoing government, regulatory and market failures we have fallen far behind in the deployment of broadband and other advanced IT services.",305,53320,200705
"Irish broadband connections have recently been increasing,",411,53320,200705
but we are still considerably behind the majority of our EU and OECD partners and failing to keep pace with the best international broadband performers.,305,53320,200705
Many Irish people have either no access to broadband services or are faced with a very limited and expensive range of services.,411,53320,200705
"The Labour Party believes that a widespread, accessible and affordable broadband network is crucial for ensuring a cohesive society,",411,53320,200705
competitive economy and to enable all Irish people to access the most technologically up-to-date services and products.,411,53320,200705
At the heart of Labour’s IT vision is also a commitment to the abolition of the digital divide,411,53320,200705
and the guarantee that a new type of social exclusion will not be fuelled by the fast-paced technological changes that are now being experienced.,503,53320,200705
"Our vision will be to create, by 2012, a new, high speed, open access, next generation telecoms network,",411,53320,200705
"designed and managed to support competing service operators that will use a variety of wireless and fixed wire “local loop” technologies, depending on local settlement patterns and geographic conditions, to deliver triple-play (TV, Internet and voice) services to every home in Ireland that wants them.",411,53320,200705
■  Establish an ambitious new government vision of how Irish broadband connectivity should develop,411,53320,200705
and the wider economic and social benefits intensified broadband development will facilitate.,411,53320,200705
"Renewed objectives, vigorously approached targets and a commitment to delivering on these targets will be a policy priority.",411,53320,200705
Set-up a specific broadband task force headed by an e-envoy to concentrate resources and responsibility in a central location to drive an intensified rollout.,411,53320,200705
The ICT industry will be encouraged to lead this development.,411,53320,200705
"Within six months of coming to power, we will tender for the upgrade and “broadband enabling” of telephone exchanges in those, mainly rural, areas where it has been uneconomic for the private sector to do so.",411,53320,200705
Introduce serious regulatory reform to ensure that the broadband sector is regulated much more effectively.,403,53320,200705
The communications regulator ComReg will have the ability to impose much greater financial penalties on telecom operators.,403,53320,200705
Operational changes will also be examined to allow ComReg to operate without the current intensely prohibitive legal restrictions and to strengthen its anticompetitive mandate.,403,53320,200705
"To expedite competition blockages and remove obstruction, a separate High Court division of regulation will be established.",403,53320,200705
Introduce co-competition powers for ComReg with the Competition Authority,403,53320,200705
"We will strengthen the hand of the regulator, and seek a settlement with Eircom to create an operationally separate network division to address the absolutely crucial problem of access to the local loop.",403,53320,200705
"This should ensure greater access for other broadband operators to provide services, and a greater variety and less expensive range of broadband products will be on offer for Irish consumers and businesses.",411,53320,200705
Promote innovative measures for the delivery of a range of platforms for delivering different broadband technologies.,411,53320,200705
"These would include a widespread designation of ‘hot spots’ for wireless transmission, and making entire urban areas ‘hot zones’ that are entirely wireless broadband enabled.",411,53320,200705
"Incorporate local government institutions including partnerships, county leaders and county development boards in broadband rollout",411,53320,200705
Create a Universal Service Obligation (USO) for broadband.,411,53320,200705
Accessibility to broadband networks will assume the same character as the present expectation of universal access to the postal service or telephone network.,411,53320,200705
The development of mechanisms for ensuring that a broadband USO is in place creates considerable potential for ensuring a widespread and universally accessible broadband network.,411,53320,200705
Instigate a national information technology education programme in order to provide the essential knowledge and training for using the critical ICT infrastructure of a modern economy.,506,53320,200705
"Although some schools provide such education, it is essential that all children regardless of the school they attend have access to a proper IT education so as to equip them with the knowledge and practical experience to participate fully in society.",506,53320,200705
Ensure access to laptops for secondary school children.,506,53320,200705
Broadband connectivity needs to have a practical application.,411,53320,200705
An objective of a national ICT policy should be the provision of all secondary school students with laptops so the relevant knowledge of and necessary skills for advanced technology can be experienced within the classroom.,411,53320,200705
"All methods of practically facilitating such a scheme, such as a partnership agreement with the IT industry, should be examined to ensure the widespread provision of laptops at second level.",506,53320,200705
"If 20th century technological development was defined by advances in the physical sciences (the transistor, the semiconductor, ICT) the 21st century will be defined by the life sciences.",411,53320,200705
Life spans will rise sharply as cures are found for chronic diseases.,411,53320,200705
Healthcare may come to be a larger share of the world economy than manufacturing.,411,53320,200705
Life science developments will likely lead to everything from further agricultural revolutions to profound changes in energy technology and the development of new materials.,411,53320,200705
Develop a National Life Sciences and Health Research Strategy to support entrepreneurs in Ireland to take advantage of the strong growth in products and services related to healthcare and the life sciences.,411,53320,200705
"We will establish a Life Sciences Research Taskforce comprising the Health Services Executive (HSE), the Health Research Board (HRB) and the industrial development agencies to develop this strategy.",411,53320,200705

"Provision of Medical assessment units to cater for patients referred by GPs or A&E units, where patients can be seen in comfort and dignity, be assessed, undergo tests, be treated, and await admission to an acute bed.",504,53320,200705
Patients referred by a GP should not have to wait hours in an A&E to be seen by a less experienced doctor.,504,53320,200705
Protocols should be drawn up so that patients referred by GPs would be seen by a consultant within a specified period.,504,53320,200705

"However, this figure assumes that global demand for carbon credits will remain reasonably static.",501,53320,200705
The truth is that the direct cost of failing to meet our CO2 reduction target could be up to €750m for the first Kyoto period alone.,501,53320,200705
Ireland needs to take serious action now to meet our Kyoto commitments and to position ourselves for a medium to long-term economic climate where energy and environmental issues will dominate.,416,53320,200705

Labour is committed to keeping Ireland nuclear free and will not establish any nuclear facility in the state.,416,53320,200705
We will continue to oppose the Sellafield plant and other installations in the UK which pose a risk to our people.,416,53320,200705
Climate change is a global problem that can only be solved by collective action by the international community.,107,53320,200705
"The ability to make strategic foreign policy decisions at an EU level will be vital in future climate change negotiations, particularly if the EU is to exploit its diplomatic and economic power to the full.",107,53320,200705
"■  Labour is committed to supporting a Climate Change Protocol to the stalled Constitutional Treaty, setting out what the EU-27 would do to tackle climate change through the mechanisms it creates.",108,53320,200705
"We believe that this could also help to break the European deadlock, and to underscore to the citizens of the EU the relevance of a strong, cohesive union that can act in their interests on this major global issue.",108,53320,200705
Ireland is the ‘dirty man’ of Europe.,501,53320,200705
"As well as producing the most CO2 per capita in the EU, we also produce more waste per capita than our fellow EU citizens.",501,53320,200705
"Over the past ten years, the European Commission has initiated legal proceedings against the Irish government for no less than thirty infringements of environmental directives.",501,53320,200705
Included in these is the failure to ensure that potentially fatal bacteria were absent from Irish drinking water.,501,53320,200705
One of the most pressing environmental challenges we face is waste.,501,53320,200705
Improvements in recycling rates are eroded by the fact that we are still producing more and more waste every year.,501,53320,200705
A growing waste problem such as Ireland’s is a by-product of greater affluence.,501,53320,200705
"An expanding economy and growing population mean that unless we tackle our consumption patterns and disposal habits now, we will face some extremely hard choices over the coming years.",501,53320,200705
"The outgoing government has primarily focused on the problem of disposal, and has made the choice to divert waste to local incinerators.",501,53320,200705
"However, incinerators can have negative environmental and public health impacts, which is why they are rarely welcomed by local communities.",501,53320,200705
Dressing incineration up as ‘Energy from Waste’ does not make it any more palatable.,501,53320,200705
Burning municipal (or ‘wet and dry’) waste is an extremely inefficient way of generating energy.,501,53320,200705
"Furthermore, these incinerators need be ‘fed’ to guarantee the electricity they do produce, thereby doing away with incentives to recycle or cut down on waste.",501,53320,200705
Simply cutting down on waste reduces or even eliminates the need for unsightly landfill and unwanted incinerators.,501,53320,200705
We can legislate to cut down on non-biodegradable packaging and make it easier for householders to recycle as much of their waste as possible.,501,53320,200705
"Furthermore, joined-up policy on waste reduction and recycling can create jobs.",416,53320,200705
"Instead of the current policy, which would drive the creation of incinerators and waste to fill them, we could get ‘Money from Waste’ in the form of a domestic recycling industry.",416,53320,200705
At present we pay for three quarters of our recycling to be done abroad.,501,53320,200705
"If we had a strong indigenous recycling industry, it would be in our financial as well as our environmental interests to ‘feed’ that industry as much as possible through high levels of recycling.",416,53320,200705
Waste is just one area where we need a real commitment to sustainable environmental policies.,501,53320,200705
"Fast-tracking investment in drinking water facilities is another, as demonstrated by the recent crisis in Galway.",501,53320,200705
"Declining water quality in our lakes and rivers, poor conservation of biodiversity and our countryside, dirty, littered streets, rocketing carbon emissions and the retreat from action on Sellafield sully the record of the past ten years.",501,53320,200705
"The environment and environmental services have been a low priority for the outgoing government,",501,53320,200705
"the price for which will be paid by households and communities around the country, and future generations.",501,53320,200705
"Establish a National Waste Management Agency, which will include a state authority for recycling charged with the development of recycling infrastructure and a market for recycled products.",501,53320,200705
Remove any charge for the collection of waste destined for recycling.,501,53320,200705
We believe that householders should be rewarded for making sound environmental choices.,501,53320,200705
"We will introduce a National Waiver Scheme for domestic charges, which would be binding on local authorities and which would apply to low-income households, pensioners, large families and people with special needs.",501,53320,200705
"Aim for every household in Ireland to recycle 50 per cent of their waste by 2012, rising to 75 per cent by 2020.",501,53320,200705

Significantly increase native broad leaf species according to RIO 2000 and implement a Timber Policy that ensures timbers and wood-based products used in public buildings come from responsibly managed forests.,501,53320,200705
Labour in government will bring forward a National Coastal Zone Management Plan.,501,53320,200705
This plan will give local authorities defined functions for the protection of their coastal amenities and for the provision and maintenance of coastal infrastructure.,501,53320,200705
We will reform the legislation governing developments in the coastal zone.,501,53320,200705
"We will pursue a policy aimed at maximising public access to our coastal amenities, protecting the coastal environment and supporting coastal communities.",501,53320,200705
Transpose the two EU directives guaranteeing citizen rights in relation to public participation and access to environmental information into Irish law and fully implement the same.,501,53320,200705
"Ratify the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decisionmaking and access to justice in environmental matters.",501,53320,200705
Set up an Appeals Board to enable citizens to challenge dredging and other licenses granted at sea without having to go to the High Court.,501,53320,200705
Provide representation for environmental groups in key forums including the National Economic and Social Forum,501,53320,200705
and the national ‘Working Group on Public Participation’ under the Water Framework Directive.,202,53320,200705
Establish an Environmental Pillar in the social partnership process.,501,53320,200705
All of our new model schools will incorporate lowenergy and environmentally-sustainable design features.,416,53320,200705
We will also work with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to incorporate environmental education and civic responsibility across the primary and second level curricula and into the ethos of education in Ireland.,501,53320,200705
Labour in government set in motion the first comprehensive and coordinated campaign against the British nuclear industry.,305,53320,200705
It was the work of a team of scientists and legal experts established when Labour was last in government which led to the British government refusing permission for the NIREX dump.,501,53320,200705
"However, under the current administration that team of experts has been disbanded,",501,53320,200705
and the inter-ministerial working party on Sellafield downgraded.,501,53320,200705
Labour in government will reinvigorate the national campaign against Sellafield.,501,53320,200705
We will upgrade the Ministerial task force and resource the RPII to monitor the threat from Sellafield.,102,53320,200705
We will work with NGOs campaigning against Sellafield.,102,53320,200705
"The threat from Sellafield and British nuclear power stations will be taken seriously, as opposed to the belated and confused approach of the outgoing government and its unfortunate Minister for nuclear emergencies.",305,53320,200705
A detailed and workable emergency plan will be drawn up with open public participation in the strategy process.,305,53320,200705
"We will also legislate to comply with Ireland’s obligations under the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,",105,53320,200705
and will promote nuclear disarmament in international forums.,105,53320,200705
Irish society has changed radically since the Garda Síochána was founded in 1922.,601,53320,200705
"There are more crimes, more drug and alcohol abuse, more public order offences and more anti-social behaviour, making life a misery for so many citizens.",606,53320,200705
"Whole communities – including some of our most marginalised communities – have suffered in their quality of life due to lawlessness, vandalism and anti-social behaviour.",606,53320,200705
"Yet despite the fact that growth in crime and antisocial behaviour – and, in particular, the impact of alcohol and illicit drugs on crime – have created new demands on policing, Ireland’s policing structures are virtually unchanged since the foundation of the state.",605,53320,200705
"Our police force has a proud tradition of service,",605,53320,200705
both to the Irish people and to the communities they have served with the UN abroad.,605,53320,200705
But tradition alone will not provide the Irish people with the world class modern police service they deserve and which the Garda Síochána could provide.,605,53320,200705
"The ingredients for such a world class system already exist, but the Gardaí are currently falling short of that goal, and there is a decline in public confidence in the force.",605,53320,200705
"In a changing world there is an increasing need for the Garda Síochána to adapt and change, so that it can better serve the community.",605,53320,200705
"The Garda Síochána must become a modern, effective police service",202,53320,200705
"with a firm commitment to community policing, modern management structures and proper systems of accountability.",605,53320,200705
"Labour believes we need more Gardaí on the ground – on the beat,patrolling our neighbourhoods.",605,53320,200705
This can only be achieved by speeding up the pace of reform within the Garda Síochána.,605,53320,200705
"We need changes in structure, organisation management in order to ensure the most effectdeployment of the Gardaí and the most efficipossible use of resources.",605,53320,200705
In particular the situatwhere virtually all key decisions in regard to policare made by just two people – the Minister for Justand the Garda Commissioner – is no lonappropriate and new procedures for democraccountability are required.,202,53320,200705
We will reform our policing service from the top down and the bottom up.,605,53320,200705
"At the top, we will ensure increased public scrutiny and greater accountability of the Gardaí through a new Garda Authority, representative of civil society, to stand between the Commissioner and his officers on the one hand, and the Minister for Justice and his Department on the other.",202,53320,200705
The Authority will incorporate the current Garda Inspectorate and will drive the reform agenda and drive efficiency and effectiveness.,202,53320,200705
"■ Revising Garda rostering, so that Gardaí are on the streets where and when they are most needed.",605,53320,200705
"■ Driving a comprehensive civilianisation programme, so that the maximum number of Gardaí are available for frontline duties.",605,53320,200705
■ Opening up senior Garda recruitment to external candidates and ensuring the best recruitment and promotion practices are operated.,605,53320,200705
■ Improving Garda diversity to reflect changes in Ireland’s population profile.,605,53320,200705
"■ Using performance data from different Garda regions, districts and divisions, to drive innovation and initiative in tackling crime.",605,53320,200705
■ Top-heavy Garda management will be streamlined with greater responsibilities going to regional Assistant Commissioners to take powers in their own areas.,301,53320,200705
The Garda Commissioner will be expected to relinquish routine day-to-day affairs to Deputy Commissioners.,605,53320,200705
■ Garda equipment will be continually updated with essential items such as stab vests and pepper sprays.,605,53320,200705
Labour’s commitment is to a system of community policing where Gardaí participate in the community and respond to the needs of that community and where the community participates in its own policing and supports the Gardaí.,605,53320,200705
Triple the number of community Gardaí to 1500 within three years.,605,53320,200705
"Place a much greater emphasis on community policing throughout the force, including recognition of the special status of the Community Garda.",605,53320,200705
"This will involve a much greater physical presence on the ground – walking the beat, visible on public transport, visiting schools.",605,53320,200705
Community Gardaí will stay working in their communities for significant periods of time and will not be diverted from community duties at the drop of a hat.,605,53320,200705
Garda organisational structures will be amended to reflect a focus on community-based policing and an acknowledgement of the value of the Gardaí involved in it.,605,53320,200705
"Community policing will be a serious career option for Gardaí, in which they can reasonably expect advancement.",605,53320,200705
"Develop new community policing structures, through local policing forums in individual communities, to reconnect the Gardaí and local communities in a spirit of genuine partnership.",301,53320,200705
A successful community policing programme will mean that residents will be able to personally name their community Garda – the contact point responsible for the visible policing of their community.,605,53320,200705
A real commitment to visible and effective community policing will require the recruitment of additional Gardaí and not the diversion of serving members.,605,53320,200705
"This will mean a policing service of at least 15,000 in the lifetime of the next government, even allowing for the numbers of existing Gardaí who are released back into core policing duties through greater civilianisation and more effective rostering.",605,53320,200705
Further increases in Garda numbers would follow from recommendations to government by the Garda Authority.,303,53320,200705
Increase recruitment from areas with the worst crime and anti-social behaviour and from minorities.,705,53320,200705
"Garda training will be enhanced in key areas including: firearms training, driver training, legal training, urban crowd control, traffic management, human rights, domestic violence and sexual offences.",605,53320,200705
This will include shared training with members of the PSNI.,605,53320,200705
"Training of Garda recruits will be reformed to include time spent in a mainstream third level institution, in an urban setting.",605,53320,200705
Our response to anti-social behaviour is not confined to just a policing plan.,606,53320,200705
Increase the number of Juvenile Liaison Officers,504,53320,200705
and increase the resources for the Probation & Welfare system.,504,53320,200705
Fund and commence all sections of the Children Act 2001.,706,53320,200705
"Set up new sporting and leisure activities, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.",706,53320,200705
Extend the Drugs Court and a system of restorative justice that has proved so successful in dealing with young offenders in other jurisdictions.,504,53320,200705
"Mandate the proposed Sport and Recreation Ireland  in partnership with the Department of Justice, the Garda and the probation service to develop physical activity programmes for young offenders,",504,53320,200705
including adventure/outward bound type programmes.,705,53320,200705
The scale and nature of criminal activity in Ireland is changing.,605,53320,200705
"On the one hand, there has been a serious escalation in gangland crime.",605,53320,200705
We have seen the terrible death toll as drug gangs feud on our streets.,605,53320,200705
"Sadly, as Labour had repeatedly warned, the innocent have become caught in the cross-fire.",605,53320,200705
"We cannot, as a country, as a people, shrug our shoulders as the gangsters kill each other.",605,53320,200705
We cannot allow life to become cheap.,605,53320,200705
"At the same time, Labour is all too aware of the damage done by anti-social behaviour.",605,53320,200705
"We know the fear and intimidation suffered by the victims, who are often themselves vulnerable people.",605,53320,200705
Labour has always stood for civil rights.,605,53320,200705
But we must also stand with those who seek only the quiet enjoyment of their neighbourhood and their community.,605,53320,200705
"Both the growth of gangland crime,",605,53320,200705
and the worsening problem of anti-social behaviour contribute to an undermining of confidence in the legal code and in the administration of justice.,605,53320,200705
"They expose weaknesses in a justice system which is often antiquated, inaccessible, remote, and unresponsive to the needs of contemporary Ireland.",605,53320,200705
"A comprehensive process of reform is required, including the courts, the prisons, the probation service and the system of juvenile justice.",605,53320,200705
"Effective policing is smart policing, using the tactics of the 21st Century to penetrate and bring down highly organised gangs of motivated and ruthless individuals.",605,53320,200705
Organised gangs thrive in a climate of fear.,605,53320,200705
It is this climate of fear and coercion that is the greatest stumbling block in tackling organised crime.,605,53320,200705
The Gardaí need the resources to assure innocent people under threat that their complaints will be dealt with thoroughly and in safety.,605,53320,200705
"As proposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, Labour in government will put an effective and reliable Garda witness protection programme on a proper statutory footing.",605,53320,200705
We will ensure that resources are available to have both the Criminal Assets Bureau,605,53320,200705
and Garda Regional Drugs Units operational on the ground throughout the country.,605,53320,200705
We recognise a deepening public disquiet about the juvenile justice system.,605,53320,200705
"Despite the dedication of many, it is a system that regularly fails the children who come in contact with it, deeply frustrates the professionals who work in it and unnecessarily exposes the wider community to criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.",605,53320,200705
"The response to juvenile offending in Ireland is fragmented, uncoordinated and sometimes selfcontradictory.",605,53320,200705
It fails to provide at risk young people with constructive alternatives and opportunities in life so that they would not consider crime either feasible or desirable.,605,53320,200705
"We will give the National Children’s Office, under the Minister for Children, a statutory mandate, responsibility and resources for youth justice.",706,53320,200705
"It will co-ordinate a cohesive and organised service provision and will ensure that high standards of rights protection are maintained by all agencies including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, the Garda Síochána, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Courts Service, the Prison Service, the HSE and the Special Residential Services Board.",706,53320,200705
"The National Children’s Office will have its own vote, its own accounting officer and have political accountability to its own Minister.",706,53320,200705
At times as many as 40 per cent of places in our child detention schools are occupied by children who have not been sentenced for a criminal offence but have been remanded there due to behaviour or emotional needs.,706,53320,200705
The misplacement of a significant proportion of the population results from the fact that many young people are placed not on the basis of need but on the basis of which places are available.,706,53320,200705
"One of the main difficulties facing the juvenile justice system is recruiting and retaining suitable, qualified and experienced staff.",706,53320,200705
And the high level of staff turnover poses difficulties in creating a stable environment for the children.,706,53320,200705
Many justice and welfare centres are operating well below full capacity due to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and experienced staff.,706,53320,200705
The Children Act 2001 is an important piece of progressive legislation.,706,53320,200705
The Children Act could have been a very significant stepping stone towards a better way of doing things but the reality is that there has been a complete failure to create an effective system to implement the Act.,305,53320,200705
The professional and other resources necessary to make implementation fully effective have not been made available.,305,53320,200705
Fully implement the Children Act 2001.,706,53320,200705
Invest resources in community and statutory services to adequately support the effective implementation of the Act.,706,53320,200705
Put in place appropriate and comprehensive support services and resource the HSE to fulfil its child protection functions in order to prevent children becoming involved in conflict with the law.,706,53320,200705
Allocate resources to provide rehabilitative and support services for children and young people with drug or alcohol problems and services for children and young people with mental health difficulties.,706,53320,200705
Introduce bail supervision and support schemes to avoid children committing crimes on bail,706,53320,200705
"Give priority to the preventive elements of the 2001 Act and to the investment of resources in community and statutory services necessary to support these measures, including adequate staffing of the social welfare service.",706,53320,200705
"Emphasise the resourcing of community-based, non-custodial options and the provision of community supervision services, step-down facilities and after-care services.",706,53320,200705
End the practice of placing non-offending children in facilities for offenders.,706,53320,200705
"Children with severe emotional or behavioural problems should not be placed in facilities for offenders, including juvenile justice institutions or the adult prison system.",706,53320,200705
Correct the practice of misplacing children in Children Detention Schools.,706,53320,200705
Provide specialised community services (and if necessary residential services) to meet the needs of certain at-risk children and adolescents.,706,53320,200705
"These children include those with learning disabilities, acute psychiatric illnesses, children requiring medically supervised detoxification for drug use, persistent school non-attendees and those at risk of leaving home.",706,53320,200705
Culturally appropriate prevention services are needed to tackle the disproportionate representation of children from the Travelling Community in detention.,706,53320,200705
Fill vacancies in the social work service to provide children with access to care and counselling services without delays.,706,53320,200705
"Implement a drive to recruit and retain suitable, qualified and experienced staff.",706,53320,200705
In many estates and neighbourhoods residents still live in dread of so-called ‘joyriders’.,605,53320,200705
We will provide in law for an offence of joyriding: directing or participating in the unlawful taking of a vehicle for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place.,605,53320,200705
And we will support and resource education and training programmes,504,53320,200705
and dedicated mentoring support aimed at this segment of the youth population.,504,53320,200705
"Restorative justice also has its role, as well as community service orders.",504,53320,200705
"Legislate for a flexible mechanism for allocating cases, as between the Circuit and High (Central Criminal) Courts, to the court and venue best placed to ensure a fair and speedy trial.",605,53320,200705
Increase the number of judges available to hear criminal trials and we will reduce the summer vacation for the Circuit Court from its present 8 weeks.,605,53320,200705
"In the Dublin area, we will put in place local district courts in each of the main areas of the city and county.",605,53320,200705
"In this way, the local judges can build up an understanding of the impact of antisocial behaviour, including drug abuse and drug pushing, on local communities, get to know the offending families, acquire an appreciation of local needs in terms of the community sanctions and community service orders they impose and so discharge in a visible way their obligations to the community for the way they run its court.",605,53320,200705
Establish a full-time Court of Criminal Appeal and give it jurisdiction to hear appeals in bail cases.,605,53320,200705
Review the current structure of the Legal Aid system to improve access to the courts.,503,53320,200705
We believe that wherever possible child custody and access cases should be dealt with through mediation and that the state should develop appropriate mediation structures.,504,53320,200705
Introduce case management procedures for criminal trials including a preliminary hearing designed to resolve the issues which ought to be agreed in advance of trial.,605,53320,200705
"Identify areas in which evidence should be agreed or admitted, including admission of expert reports",303,53320,200705
Identify any evidence which might require to be taken by video-link and to make arrangements for the taking of such evidence,303,53320,200705
"Ascertain any other arrangements which may have to be made regarding information technology, use of interpreters or other facilities",303,53320,200705
Enable the determination of those types of issue of admissibility of evidence which are capable of being dealt with prior to trial,303,53320,200705
Receive and deal with a plea of guilty or fix a hearing for sentencing,303,53320,200705
Identify any issue of insanity or fitness to plead which may arise,303,53320,200705
Enable the court to establish the likely length of the trial,303,53320,200705
"Cooperation by an accused – having received legal advice – with the objectives of the preliminary hearing will be recognised as a factor to which the court will give consideration when imposing sentence if there is a conviction, in the same way as it may take into account the stage at which a plea of guilty is made.",303,53320,200705
The criminal courts show inconsistencies in their sentences.,605,53320,200705
This is because there are no sentencing guidelines for the judiciary and consequently no consistency between judges.,605,53320,200705
"Introduce a new Sentencing Act, which will provide for sentencing guidelines, binding on the courts, to reduce the disparities between sentences handed down in similar cases.",605,53320,200705
The Act will specify aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account.,605,53320,200705
Putting the victim in fear of injury will be a serious aggravating factor in any offence against the person.,605,53320,200705
Judges will be required to give reasons for their sentences and for any departure from the guidelines in individual cases.,605,53320,200705
"The DPP will be given the function of advising a court, by reference to the sentencing guidelines, as to the accepted range of appropriate sentences for the offence committed in the circumstances of the case.",605,53320,200705
Oblige all courts to give clear and adequate reasons for their decisions and to record in writing the reasons for decisions involving a custodial sentence.,605,53320,200705
Enact comprehensive legislation for the updating and indexation of fines in criminal statutes.,605,53320,200705
"We will give effect to the principle of equality of impact, so that a fine may be increased for more affluent offenders and decreased for offenders of more limited means.",605,53320,200705
There is a surprising lack of accessible information on the case management process in our criminal justice system.,605,53320,200705
"And the Gardaí, the courts and the prisons use different and incompatible counting systems.",605,53320,200705
"We will create a national register of crime statistics, which will receive and process in a coherent and unified way the figures from all agencies involved in the criminal justice system, including a register of sentences.",605,53320,200705
"Our prison system is antiquated, expensive and ineffective.",504,53320,200705
The reformation and rehabilitation of offenders is at best sporadic and at worst non-existent.,605,53320,200705
"On a daily basis prisoners, many of them able-bodied and capable, walk aimlessly around prison yards or are locked up to lie in bed for over 17 out of every 24 hours.",605,53320,200705
"Prison does nothing to prepare its inhabitants to lead a crime-free, socially responsible life.",504,53320,200705
"Consolidate and modernise our prison legislation, much of which dates from the nineteenth century.",504,53320,200705
"Both the Prisons Service and the Parole Board will be established by statute, independently of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.",504,53320,200705
Implement the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum Report on the Re-integration of Prisoners.,504,53320,200705
We will introduce a comprehensive rehabilitation programme of positive sentence management based on individual needs analysis and a planned programme for all first offenders.,504,53320,200705
Plan for reintegration as the norm,504,53320,200705
"Provide personal and educational skills and fill any gaps in work, training, education, welfare etc.",504,53320,200705
Treat mental or physical health problems and addictions,504,53320,200705
"Develop a special role for prison officers, the probation and welfare services and other training and education agencies",504,53320,200705
Provide strong links from custody to the wider community,504,53320,200705
Provide on-going support to former prisoners seeking and maintaining employment.,504,53320,200705
The jurisdiction of the Ombudsman will be extended to deal with complaints about the Prison Service.,605,53320,200705
The Probation and Welfare Service continues to be under-staffed and under-resourced.,504,53320,200705
There are too many people in prison who don’t need to be there because the resources have not been made available to the probation service.,504,53320,200705
We will provide a statutory footing and operational independence for the Probation and Welfare Service,504,53320,200705
and we will give it a clearly defined role.,504,53320,200705
We will progressively increase staffing and resources in the Probation Service.,504,53320,200705
Community-based sanctions are significantly less costly to implement than custodial sentences.,605,53320,200705
Implementing community service orders costs about one-third of the cost to the public of implementing the custodial sentences that might otherwise be imposed.,605,53320,200705
We will repeal the outdated and inadequate Probation of Offenders Act 1907,605,53320,200705
and we will enact new legislation to provide for a statutory institutional framework for the Service and additional non-custodial sanctions.,605,53320,200705
"We will give the courts system the widest possible scope to make appropriate sentences, including restorative justice measures, probation and welfare services, and formal cautioning.",504,53320,200705
"Ensure that offenders can be placed under a probation supervision order, under which conditions such as a curfew or staying away from certain areas can be attached.",504,53320,200705
"If offenders are not fully compliant, a term of imprisonment can be activated.",504,53320,200705
They can also be sentenced to community service orders.,504,53320,200705
"Under these, an individual can be ordered to do up to 240 hours of community work.",504,53320,200705
Ensure that those brought before the courts can also be ordered to undergo treatment for drugs or alcohol addiction.,605,53320,200705
"In the case of sex offenders, particularly those involved in internet child pornography, they can be ordered to participate in long-term therapy such as that offered by the Dublin-based Granada Institute.",504,53320,200705
We strongly favour restorative justice programmes and Community Service Orders.,504,53320,200705
"These should involve young offenders being required to confront the implications of their actions for the community, and where possible to be involved in cleaning up after those who have been involved in anti-social activity.",504,53320,200705
■  We also strongly support the concept underlying the Drug Referral Programme.,504,53320,200705
There are currently only two community-based pilot reparation programmes in Ireland.,504,53320,200705
Victims of crime are still treated by the criminal justice system as just another potential witness.,605,53320,200705

"Work towards a new protocol for communications by the DPP with victims of crime, so as to improve the responsiveness of that office.",605,53320,200705
"We will enhance public confidence in the prosecutorial system through a system of dialogue between the DPP and the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, on general issues of prosecution policy.",605,53320,200705
"It is necessary, in order to safeguard judicial independence, that judges who may be involved in issues of major controversy against the interests of the Executive are not answerable on a day-to-day basis to the government or the Oireachtas.",203,53320,200705
We claim the entitlement to remove a judge from office only where standards are breached that have serious consequences for public confidence in the administration of justice.,203,53320,200705
"Legislate for a reformed, speedy and efficient procedure to secure judicial accountability, bearing in mind a proper respect for the independence of the courts and the separation of powers under our Constitution.",203,53320,200705
"Introduce a code of judicial conduct and ethics, to be policed by the judges with professional and lay participation in an open, transparent manner that serves public confidence, in relation to matters that fall short of “impeachable” misbehaviour.",203,53320,200705
Enhance the existing minimal provisions for formal training and continuing education for judges.,203,53320,200705
We will enact a Defamation Bill to reform the law of libel and slander.,201,53320,200705
We will review the necessity for a counterbalancing Privacy Bill when the defamation bill is enacted and when the effects of the Bill in practice have been fully examined.,201,53320,200705

"On the issue of abortion, we will legislate in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the X Case.",604,53320,200705
"In addition to the all-party commitment made for a referendum on the rights of the child, Labour favours the practice of incremental constitutional reform, in tandem with local, European and general elections.",203,53320,200705
"An amendment to permit polling at local, European and general elections to be held over two days, e.g. a Saturday and Sunday, rather than being confined to one as at present.",202,53320,200705
Replacing the outdated provisions dealing with the place of women in the home with a genderneutral provision on the role of family members and carers who work in the home.,705,53320,200705
A new provision on the rights of persons with disabilities.,705,53320,200705
"An amendment replacing the present excessively restrictive rules against revealing discussions that took place at government meetings, in favour of a more open provision.",202,53320,200705
The Labour Party has a long and proud record of driving the equality agenda in Ireland.,503,53320,200705
"From decriminalising homosexual relations to providing for the availability of contraceptives and divorce, to legislating for women’s equality in the workplace, to the passing of employment equality and equal status legislation,",503,53320,200705
Labour has led the fight for an equal Ireland.,503,53320,200705
"However, the fight for effective and practical equality and human dignity for everyone is not yet won.",503,53320,200705
"More than 30 years after it became a statutory entitlement, the pay gap between men and women has yet to be bridged.",503,53320,200705
"Large sectors of the economy still depend on low-paid, often part-time ‘women’s work’.",503,53320,200705
"Care for others – particularly care in the home– continues to be undervalued, enabling the state to obtain social services on the cheap, at the expense of one gender and to the benefit of the other.",503,53320,200705
Women continue to be under-represented – if they are there at all – in decision-making arenas.,503,53320,200705
The government target of a minimum 40 per cent of each gender on State boards has not been realised.,503,53320,200705
The percentage of women in the Dáil has plateaued at 13 per cent and only one-fifth of local councillors are women.,503,53320,200705
People with disabilities must also be enabled to participate fully in society.,503,53320,200705
Yet current legislation does not recognise the right of disabled people to a similar standard of living as could reasonably be expected by any other citizen of the state.,705,53320,200705
"Our disability legislation creates no entitlements, other than an entitlement to be assessed as to one’s needs, and it places no obligation on the state to meet those needs.",705,53320,200705
"As a result, persons with disabilities and their families are cast back on the cap-in-hand, hand-to-mouth provision of services, unable to plan for their long-term future.",705,53320,200705
"More generally, changes in Irish society and the lives of its citizens have fast outpaced the law which is supposed to serve and protect them.",503,53320,200705
"There are currently over 120,000 cohabiting heterosexual unmarried couples and more than 2,000 gay couples in Ireland.",705,53320,200705
"They have no automatic rights of inheritance, no rights if their partner is sick and needs treatment and no right to apply to adopt, simply because they are not married.",705,53320,200705
"This discrimination is particularly acute in relation to gay couples, who do not have the right to marry even if they would like to.",503,53320,200705
"The fact that legal protection is largely confined to traditional family units does not stop other kinds of families from getting on with their lives, but it places them under significantstrain.",503,53320,200705
We believe that the statehas a duty to these families and others suffering from the effects of inequality in our society.,503,53320,200705
"Labour remains committed to an approach based on rights, equality and participation.",503,53320,200705
We will work to vindicate the rights of people with,705,53320,200705
"disabilities to education, health, housing and work and to participate in an inclusive manner in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.",503,53320,200705
"People with a disability are entitled to a strong, enforceable legal right",705,53320,200705
"to an assessment of their needs in relation to education, healthcare, training and residential services.",503,53320,200705
"That right must be underpinned by the resources to ensure that waiting lists are tackled quickly, in a planned way and in proper consultation.",705,53320,200705
"Our central policy commitment is short, specific and, we believe, will effect a radical change.",0,53320,200705
"At present, individual assessments of the needs of persons with a disability are ongoing.",705,53320,200705
These assessments of need will be expedited and completed.,705,53320,200705
"At the end of a two year period, the information extracted from these assessments will have been compiled into a national database of disability needs.",705,53320,200705
"The database information will be costed, in a process that is objective and independent and in which all stakeholders can have confidence.",705,53320,200705
Labour in government will use these independently arrived at costing figures to commit the necessary resources to deliver the level of service that each individual is entitled to under his or her own assessment of need.,705,53320,200705
"Allowing for inflation and for a necessary lead-in period to deliver new services and enhance existing ones, a comprehensive five year plan will be published.",705,53320,200705
"The funds necessary to deliver on this comprehensive plan will be withdrawn from the annual Estimates and Budget procedure and, for the duration of the plan, will be charged directly on the Central Fund as an ongoing statutory commitment and entitlement.",705,53320,200705
We are committed to ensuring that public transport is made wheel chair accessible.,705,53320,200705
"And we will ensure that taxi drivers who have benefited from reductions in VAT and VRT for the purchase of wheelchair accessible taxis actually provide the service for which they were given these tax concessions, by making themselves available to wheelchair users when requested.",705,53320,200705
We will review the stringent regulations governing the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions.,705,53320,200705
"We will carry out a root and branch review of the building regulations, which are completely unsuitable for the needs of people with disabilities,",705,53320,200705
and of the measures to ensure compliance with those regulations.,705,53320,200705
We aim to ensure that at least 3 per cent of all new houses and apartments are suited to the needs of an ageing population and of persons with a disability.,705,53320,200705
"As part of this approach, Labour in government will recognise the philosophy of “Independent Living” for people with disabilities.",705,53320,200705
"Independent living means practical measures to enable a person with a disability to make his or her own arrangements for personal assistance, transport, access, and so on.",705,53320,200705
Independent Living measures include enabling people with disabilities to employ personal assistants and so take control of their own lives.,705,53320,200705
"Funding for independent living means resourcing people with disabilities, and tailoring services to meet individual requirements.",705,53320,200705
Labour’s Civil Union Bill was defeated by the present government parties.,705,53320,200705
"In government, Labour will reintroduce and enact this legislation.",705,53320,200705
"The Bill will create a status relationship equivalent to marriage for the benefit of people who are of the same sex and who, under the current constitutional understanding of marriage, cannot marry each other.",705,53320,200705
"In most respects, the same rules that apply to marriage will apply to civil unions.",705,53320,200705
"Partners in a civil union will have the same rights, privileges and benefits and be subject to the same obligations, penalties and other sanctions as those that apply to spouses in a marriage.",705,53320,200705
They will also be responsible for the support of one another and for any dependent child to the same degree and in the same manner as married persons.,705,53320,200705
The Bill provides that parties to a civil union who are living together may apply to adopt a child.,705,53320,200705
The Bill also states that all adoption decisions must be made in the best long-term interests of the child.,705,53320,200705
"Our objective, in due course, is to bring about constitutional change to provide for full equality between heterosexual and homosexual couples.",705,53320,200705
"In addition, Labour will take a number of measures to improve the position and well-being of lesbian, gay and transgendered citizens in our society.",705,53320,200705
Put in place policies to tackle homophobic bullying in our second level education system.,705,53320,200705
Amend employment equality legislation to prohibit schools from discriminating against their employees on the grounds of sexual orientation or marital status.,705,53320,200705

Introduce a gay and lesbian strand to the National Anti-Poverty Strategy based on updated research on poverty issues among gay and lesbian people.,705,53320,200705
Provide for a lesbian and gay communitybuilding framework within the Pobal Strategic Plan,705,53320,200705
and amend the legislation governing Community Development Projects to allow for non-locality based community projects.,705,53320,200705
Appoint an official in the Department of Health to have responsibility for advising the Minister on LGBT health issues and for liaising with the LGBT community on same.,705,53320,200705
We are committed to on-going funding of gay HIV strategies.,705,53320,200705
"Create a national LGBT monitoring and advisory committee, under the aegis of a relevant government department",705,53320,200705
"Labour shares the commitment of all political parties to put to the people, as an immediate priority, an appropriate constitutional amendment to enshrine in explicit form the rights of the child.",706,53320,200705
"The wording will reflect the special vulnerabilities and dependencies of children and the consequent obligations owed to them, both by their families and by the State,",706,53320,200705
and will conform to the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.,706,53320,200705
"Labour is also committed, within 12 months of entering office, to bring all child protection legislation, including the Children Act 2001, finally into force and to adequately resourcing that legislation.",706,53320,200705
"In harsher times Irish emigrants made a vital difference to those left behind, yet they have been sorely neglected by the State.",705,53320,200705
"In particular, the generation who sent back the equivalent of €3.5 billion in remittances during the 1950s and 1960s deserve to be cared for and assisted in their retirement.",705,53320,200705
"We are committed to providing greater assistance and support to Irish emigrants, particularly those who have fallen on hard times.",705,53320,200705
It is right and fair that we extend our duty of care and responsibility to these Irish-born citizens.,705,53320,200705
In government we will implement the government’s Taskforce on Policy Regarding Emigrants in full.,705,53320,200705
Establish an Agency for the Irish Abroad.,705,53320,200705
Support emigrant representation in the Seanad for Irish communities oversees.,705,53320,200705

Lobby the US government to legalise the position of illegal Irish immigrants in the US while expanding opportunities for US citizens to live and work in Ireland.,705,53320,200705

Ensure all Irish-born emigrant pensioners have the right to free travel on public transport in Ireland.,705,53320,200705
Labour is committed to ensuring that state bodies and agencies achieve at least 40 per cent representation of each gender on their boards and governing bodies.,503,53320,200705
We will give statutory force to that objective and we will ensure that the social partners and other nominating bodies are bound by the same target.,706,53320,200705
We will tie public funding for political parties to the level of participation by women as public representatives those parties achieve.,706,53320,200705
Demanding targets for all parties – including our own – will be set out in legislation.,503,53320,200705
Payments to a qualified party under the Electoral Act will be reduced unless at least 33 per cent of its candidates are women.,706,53320,200705
"That 33 per cent target figure will apply to elections taking place from 2012, and will be increased to 40 per cent from 2019.",706,53320,200705
Provision will be made for circumstances where a high proportion of candidates elected are women.,706,53320,200705
We believe that it is in the public interest that public and private organisations are transparent in their recruitment and remuneration policies as they pertain to male and female staff.,706,53320,200705
"To aid this policy, we will require large public bodies and large private companies to publish the average whole time equivalent salary for male and female members of staff on an annual basis.",706,53320,200705
The insidious and increasing prevalence of domestic violence and violence against women continues to be one of the most critical issues confronting Irish society.,706,53320,200705
We are committed to tackling and eradicating domestic violence and violence against women.,706,53320,200705
"This means an integrated response tackling domestic violence, rape and sexual assault, prostitution, trafficking and pornography through providing supports and safety for the woman,",706,53320,200705
"holding accountable and sanctioning the perpetrator and those who gain economically from the abuse and commodification of women,",605,53320,200705
and giving political leadership in Irish society by holding the State ultimately responsible for the safety of women.,706,53320,200705
Our first priority is a commitment to adequate and guaranteed funding for frontline services.,706,53320,200705
"It is totally unacceptable that women in emergency need throughout the country do no have access to support, help and counselling.",706,53320,200705
Labour in government will address this deficit.,706,53320,200705
"We will provide, where missing, and upgrade, where inadequate, the physical infrastructure of appropriate refuges and places of safety.",706,53320,200705
"A second immediate priority is reform of the courts system, civil and criminal, learning from best international experience.",706,53320,200705
"We will ensure appropriate locations and adequate time are provided, with dedicated and experienced judges to deal with domestic violence cases.",706,53320,200705
"Foremost among necessary court reforms is the need to tackle the delay in hearing cases and to have ready access to the courts for urgent applications, regardless of where in Ireland the applicant lives.",706,53320,200705
We will improve Garda training in the handling of domestic abuse cases and ensure swifter penalties for the breach of barring orders.,706,53320,200705
We will legislate in Ireland and work with our European partners to tackle human trafficking.,706,53320,200705
We will develop integrated responses to sex trafficking which do not distinguish between a ‘free’ or ‘forced’ entry route into prostitution and which do not carry the threat of forced repatriation to country of origin.,706,53320,200705
"■  Given the interconnections between prostitution, trafficking and organised crime, the potential for sustained economic and fiscal sanctions for organisers and traffickers based on the Criminal Assets Bureau model will be investgated.",605,53320,200705
Labour accepts of course that the traditional family continues to contribute enormously to the common good and that it should be given special protection in the Constitution.,603,53320,200705
"However, while married life and family life are, for many people, clearly connected, it is equally clear that family life and married life are not in modern conditions either identical or inextricably linked.",604,53320,200705
We believe that other forms of family life can and should be given constitutional recognition and protection.,604,53320,200705
We see no conflict in proposing that the Constitution should recognise family life in general while giving special protection to the family based on marriage.,604,53320,200705
"This is the approach that was favoured by the Constitution Review Group, which reported in 1996.",604,53320,200705
That group recommended that the State should guarantee to all individuals respect for their family life “whether based on marriage or not”.,604,53320,200705
"We endorse, and will act upon, those recommendations first made in 1996.",604,53320,200705
A referendum on the rights of the child will also make it clear that the Constitution’s recognition of “The Family” – parents and children living together – extends to nonmarital families.,604,53320,200705
"As between cohabiting couples, Labour will act on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Colley Report to ensure that, although these couples have opted not to get married and so have opted out of the full system of mutual rights and obligations that govern marriage, the tax and social welfare codes and property and succession laws are suitably adapted in recognition and support of long-term relationships.",604,53320,200705
We will modernise the legal framework governing rights and responsiblities of unmarried fathers.,604,53320,200705
Travellers are native to Ireland; they have been part of Irish society for centuries.,705,53320,200705
"They have historically been marginalised and, as a result, the Traveller population experiences institutionalised deprivation and higher likelihoods of poor education, poor health, poor living conditions, poor relations with the law, unemployability and a markedly poor life expectancy.",705,53320,200705
"Labour is convinced that, working in a spirit of mutual respect, the difficulties encountered by a population of around 30,000 individuals are neither inevitable nor insurmountable.",705,53320,200705
"There is no shortage of policies, programmes and plans to deal with the issues, either in general terms or in relation to specifics.",705,53320,200705
What is lacking is the political will to drive these programmes forward.,705,53320,200705
"And a commitment to deliver them in partnership and co-responsibility with Travellers themselves, rather than handing them down from on high.",705,53320,200705
"■  Labour in government will establish a National Office for Travellers’ Affairs, similar to the National Children’s Office.",705,53320,200705
"The National Office will have responsibility for drawing together and overseeing delivery in relation to the various Traveller-specific programmes and plans of individual government Departments, agencies and local authorities (for example, the Travellers’ health programmes of the HSE, the Travellers’ education programmes of the Department of Education).",705,53320,200705
"The Office will hold bodies to account for their failure to draw up plans, failure to allocate resources to those plans or failure to deliver on their plans.",705,53320,200705
"Where a Department or agency is in default of its obligations, the Office will have statutory power to take over the Budgets and the executive and financial responsibilities of those bodies and to direct officials to carry out official plans within stated and specific timescales.",705,53320,200705
"The National Office and representative Traveller bodies will also be responsible for promoting relations between Travellers and other members of the community, to ensure that rights are accompanied by a recognition of corresponding responsibilities, on both sides of the community.",705,53320,200705
Childhood is precious.,706,53320,200705
Childhood is the time when children begin to encounter the world and learn how to learn.,706,53320,200705
"Childhood should be a safe and protected time, when every child is nurtured and allowed to develop to the fullness of their human potential.",706,53320,200705
"Yet, as a country, our record of protecting children and childhood is poor.",706,53320,200705
"We have a terrible legacy of institutional and other abuse, with which our society must still cope,",706,53320,200705
and we have not yet established the Rights of Children in our constitution.,706,53320,200705
One in every nine children lives in poverty.,706,53320,200705
"As the children’s author, J. K. Rowling has written “Poverty is a bad place to live on your own, but the worst place on earth if you have a child with you”.",706,53320,200705
"Child poverty results in incalculable loss of human potential,",706,53320,200705
and stores up problems for which society continues to pay for decades.,706,53320,200705
There are deep deficiencies in our health service that severely affect children.,504,53320,200705
"Across a range of areas, the provision of health services, including mental health, operates on an emergency basis, rather than on a preventative base.",504,53320,200705
"We repeatedly fail to tackle problems before they become acute, whether it be in terms of basic developmental checks, or the provision of a child psychology service in our schools.",706,53320,200705
Irish children suffer from some of the worst rates of alcohol and drug abuse in Europe.,706,53320,200705
Suicide among children and young adults is a growing reality of Irish life.,706,53320,200705
"Childcare policy, in so far as it exists, is work-focused, rather than child focused.",706,53320,200705
"Our society places too much strain on the families of young children, to balance the need to earn a living and still have time for each other.",706,53320,200705
"There is no structured system of preschool education and the schools to which we send our children are under-resourced, over-crowded and poorly designed.",706,53320,200705
"That protected space of childhood is being encroached on by pressures of commercialism, including the premature sexualisation of young people.",706,53320,200705
"Family life is under the increasing strain of longer commutes and less time at home, which places strains on both parents and children.",603,53320,200705
"Sport, recreation and play are central parts of a child’s life, just as is the development of artistic ability and awareness.",706,53320,200705
"Again, provision in these areas has a long way to go before Ireland can claim to be offering the best to our children.",706,53320,200705
"Labour shares the commitment of all political parties to put to the people, as a priority, an appropriate constitutional amendment to enshrine in explicit form the rights of the child.",706,53320,200705
"The wording will reflect the special vulnerabilities and dependencies of children and the consequent obligations owed to them, both by their families and by the State, and will conform to the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",706,53320,200705
"Labour is also committed, within 12 months of entering office, to bring all child protection legislation, including the Children Act 2001, finally into force and to adequately resourcing that legislation.",706,53320,200705
Child poverty leads to an incalculable loss of human potential.,706,53320,200705
"In the context of developing policy on support for families with children, including the early years subsidy, FIS and CDAs, we will examine reform options including a supplementary child benefit.",706,53320,200705
"We will substantially improve rates of payment under the Back to School allowance scheme, introduct a once-off payment for children entering second level education and review the income limits.",706,53320,200705
"Restructure support for one-parent families to enable those parenting alone to meet their obligations, support themselves in work and, if they choose, form sustainable relationships.",504,53320,200705
"Labour believes it is inappropriate for advertisers to target children, particularly where the advertising is promoting goods such as fast food which may be injurious to a child’s well being.",706,53320,200705

Labour is proposing to establish after-school and summer recreation programmes for young people.,706,53320,200705
These programmes will offer young people the opportunity to engage in positive and constructive activities during their spare time.,706,53320,200705
"It is also hoped that these activity programmes will function as youth diversionary programmes,",706,53320,200705
deterring young people from becoming involved in crime and anti-social behaviour.,706,53320,200705
Establish arts and sports-based after-school and summer recreation programmes,502,53320,200705
which will provide diversionary and supervised activities for young people.,706,53320,200705
"School buildings will serve an important function as the focal point and primary location for many of the the youth schemes, providing halls, basketball courts, pitches/fields etc.",706,53320,200705
We will address insurance costs by embarking on a broad review of the school insurance system.,303,53320,200705
"In addition to school facilities, the schemes will work in partnership with local community sports clubs, making use of facilities such as GAA, soccer and rugby pitches, tennis courts and swimming-pools.",502,53320,200705
The schemes will be staffed in part by thirdlevel students in a system similar to the Student Summer Job Scheme that ran successfully from 1993 to 2002.,504,53320,200705
"In addition to third-level students, the schemes will employ a small number of more senior staff experienced in working with children or in sports organisations to manage each individual programme.",504,53320,200705
The schemes will be run at a local government level.,301,53320,200705
Labour will appoint a full-time youth recreation co-ordinator for each local authority.,706,53320,200705
"The main responsibility of the post will be to co-ordinate the schedule; employ staff; and liaise with school representatives, local sports clubs, the Gardaí and other relevant parties in designing and running activities.",303,53320,200705
Labour will ensure that schemes are attended by adolescents from a wide range of social backgrounds.,706,53320,200705
We will tailor activities to meet the interests of young people,706,53320,200705
by consulting with young people prior to setting up the scheme and during operation of the scheme.,202,53320,200705
The schemes will include a wide range of sports and activities to appeal to boys and girls of different ages.,706,53320,200705
Labour will ensure the full and complete rolling out of the 2001 Youth Work Act and the 2003-2007 National Youth Work Development Plan.,706,53320,200705
We will support a new Youth Work Development Plan for 2007-2011.,706,53320,200705
We are committed to a vibrant and active voluntary youth work sector.,706,53320,200705
We want to see an enhanced partnership between local voluntary youth services and VECs based on mutual trust and a shared vision.,706,53320,200705
"Developing quality, relevant and accessible facilities and services for young people.",706,53320,200705
"There should be a quality multi-purpose youth facility in every major urban centre with more than 5,000 people.",706,53320,200705
"Combining relevant funding from Youth Affairs, Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, other exchequer sources, local authority funding, private sector capital, philanthropic funds and new public resources where necessary to support these quality facilities and services.",706,53320,200705
Providing for properly resourced staff to run facilities and services.,706,53320,200705
Using resources from the above to create for the first time a capital fund for youth work and youth services at local level.,706,53320,200705
Ireland faces a demographic revolution for which it is largely unprepared.,504,53320,200705
"Over the coming decades the number of citizens aged over 65 is set to double, while the number of those living beyond 85 will treble.",504,53320,200705
"Advances in medicine, diet and incomes have transformed the nature of old age, but they have also changed our expectations of it.",504,53320,200705
"Senior citizens are more active, remain independent for longer and expect to partake fully in society.",706,53320,200705
Yet society has failed to respond to these changes with public policies capable of meeting these new expectations and satisfying these needs.,706,53320,200705
The increased longevity of our population is a cause for celebration.,706,53320,200705
"This is not a problem, but rather an opportunity.",706,53320,200705
"It is an opportunity for our older citizens to avail of activities, opportunities and resources that they did not have before and it is an opportunity for society as a whole to avail of their wisdom, skills and resources.",706,53320,200705
"Among the primary requirements for the enjoyment of the older years are adequate incomes and good health services, including long-term care.",706,53320,200705
"While virtually all older people want to continue to live in their own homes,",706,53320,200705
"and the vast majority succeeds in doing so, Ireland lacks a coherent and rational system for supporting those who can stay at home, and caring for those who cannot.",706,53320,200705
Older people face particular forms of discrimination and are often treated as invisible by the state and by wider society.,706,53320,200705
"In a world that can be heavily youthfocused, the contribution that older people make must be recognised.",706,53320,200705
"However, we should go beyond simply giving our senior citizens their due to ask what we can do to actively improve their quality of life.",706,53320,200705
We need to move the debate about aging on from health and maintenance alone to how older people can be enabled to make the best of their senior years.,706,53320,200705
Our challenge is to create An Age Friendly Society.,706,53320,200705
"To succeed, we need to introduce fundamental change across the full spectrum of public policy.",706,53320,200705
It is the responsibility of government to create An Age Friendly Society as recommended by the Council on Ageing and Older People.,706,53320,200705
"Labour’s strategy for senior citizens will be founded on the UN Principles for Older Persons: Independence, Participation, Care, Self-fulfilment and Dignity.",706,53320,200705
Improving and enhancing the lives of our older citizens requires a whole of government approach.,706,53320,200705
"We will establish an Office for Senior Citizens, similar in design to the Office for Children, to address issues relating to aging from a ‘whole of government’ perspective.",706,53320,200705
"There are few groups in society more vulnerable, or dependent on others to assert rights on their behalf, than older people.",706,53320,200705
We will establish an ombudsman for older people,503,53320,200705
"We will end discrimination against older people, including:",503,53320,200705
We will ensure that upper age limits do not apply to screening services.,503,53320,200705
We will implement a programme of training in the health services to ensure that older people are not treated in a discriminatory manner.,503,53320,200705
We will change the legislation which prevents people aged 70 and over from serving on juries.,503,53320,200705
Everyone will be eligible to serve but people over 65 will be excusable as of right.,503,53320,200705
We will change other legislation which imposes an upper age limit on people serving on certain state boards.,503,53320,200705
"Older people, like all others, need an adequate income in order to avoid poverty and to enjoy a good quality of life.",706,53320,200705
The State Pension needs to be significantly enhanced in order to provide older people with an adequate income.,706,53320,200705
Raise the level of the State non-Contributory pension to €300 by 2012.,706,53320,200705
Introduce a National Waiver Scheme to meet the cost of service charges in all areas – this would replace the current waiver scheme and also provide assistance to those people who cannot avail of the waiver scheme because the services are provided by private companies.,706,53320,200705
Allow non-contributory pensioners to earn money from self-employment as well as employment without affecting their pension.,706,53320,200705
Provide specific training programmes for older people who wish to work or be self-employed.,706,53320,200705
"We will introduce a more flexible approach to retirement so that those who wish to work beyond 65, and are capable of doing so, will have a statutory entitlement to protection against being required to retire on grounds of age subject to necessary exceptions (e. g. in defence and security).",706,53320,200705
"Older people are entitled to live active lives, to avail of opportunities for education and personal development,",706,53320,200705
and to play a full part in the life of the community.,706,53320,200705
"Develop an ‘Out And About’ €1 ticket scheme, which will allow people over 65 access to sporting and cultural venues.",706,53320,200705
"We will include relevant state-supported cultural venues, and invite major sporting organisations to participate.",706,53320,200705
"Our goal is to provide older people with access to theatres, concert venues, sports stadia for €1.",706,53320,200705
"Bringing the scheme into operation will require negotiation with major sporting and cultural organisations, but we believe they will appreciate the benefits to them of such a scheme.",706,53320,200705
"Many seniors are anxious to continue to contribute their time, energy, skills and wisdom to their community and to their country.",706,53320,200705
"We will issue a call to service to all people over 65 years who wish to give of their time and skills, individually or in groups,",706,53320,200705
"and will establish a national database of older volunteers which can be accessed by voluntary organisations and NGOs, who will in turn be encouraged to call on the skills of older people.",706,53320,200705
We will put in place a specific access to education programme for those older people who wish to avail of it.,706,53320,200705
We will help voluntary organisations to arrange transport and other facilities to enable older people to avail of the opportunities provided by sports and culture programmes.,706,53320,200705
We will introduce a number of measures to address the problems of elder abuse,706,53320,200705
and to ensure protection for vulnerable adults.,706,53320,200705
The vast majority of older people are able to make and implement their own decisions and they do not need any special protection.,706,53320,200705
A minority does need protection and they are not adequately catered for at present.,706,53320,200705
"They need protection from abuse whether it is physical, mental, sexual or financial.",706,53320,200705
"We will put in place a protection system for vulnerable older people, including those who may be subject to physical, emotional, sexual or financial abuse.",706,53320,200705
We will also introduce substitute decision making and protection arrangements for vulnerable adults along the lines of the proposals put forward by the Law Reform Commission.,706,53320,200705
This means that adults who are unable to make decisions may have adult guardians appointed to make decisions on their behalf.,706,53320,200705
There will be an overall supervisory Public Guardian system to ensure that vulnerable adults are protected.,706,53320,200705
This system will also supervise social welfare agency arrangements.,706,53320,200705
Special protections will be provided for people in long stay care.,706,53320,200705
"Long term care arrangements for older people in Ireland are unplanned, inadequate, inequitable and under-funded.",503,53320,200705
"People who are in need of care, and especially those who have to leave their homes and go into long stay institutional care, are among the most vulnerable members of our society.",706,53320,200705
A civilised society which respects human rights and promotes human dignity should be judged on the way care is provided for the elderly,706,53320,200705
and on the quality of life provided by the care system.,706,53320,200705
"Provide at least 1500 public long stay beds immediately, 600 of them in Dublin.",706,53320,200705
"Provide for an assessment of need leading to an individual care plan, based either on enabling a person to live at home with appropriate adaptations and/or supports, which includes financial supports and respite care, or on providing  a supported living arrangement.",706,53320,200705
Equivalent financial arrangements should be made for people who need care and who live at home as for people who go into long stay care.,706,53320,200705
These arrangements will be transparent and equitable.,706,53320,200705
"Legislate for the right to core community care services, such as home nursing, care assistant and home help services.",706,53320,200705
"Integrate community care and housing policies so that older people may have a range of residential options and supported living arrangements, including staying in their own homes with adaptations if necessary, sheltered housing, community homes and public and private nursing homes.",706,53320,200705
"Ensure that all care facilities, public and private, are subject to stringent quality control, through the establishment of a Patient Safety Authority.",706,53320,200705
Ensure that all senior citizens are involved in decisions about their care.,706,53320,200705
Put in place a system of substitute decision making for older people who are unable to make decisions for themselves.,706,53320,200705
Continue the provision of free GP services to the over 70s.,706,53320,200705
"We will also expand the number of medical cards to cover 40 per cent of the population, which will ensure that a much greater number of older people will be eligible for a medical card.",706,53320,200705
"Tackle the deficiencies in the availability of Home Care Nurses, care assistants and home helps.",706,53320,200705
We will abolish the means test for carers.,706,53320,200705
"Introduce tight regulation over equity release schemes, and provide independent advice, through the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, on the rights and options of seniors who own property.",706,53320,200705
It is clear that only a small proportion of older people who need extensive care can afford to pay for this service from their own resources.,706,53320,200705
"Labour believes that the medical and nursing element of long-term care should be free of charge, as it would be to an older person with any other medical condition.",706,53320,200705
"We consider that those who can afford to do so should be required to pay for, or contribute towards, the cost of their personal care and maintenance.",706,53320,200705
This should be subject to the person having an income for personal needs which is consistent with human dignity.,706,53320,200705
We do not consider that family members other than spouses should be required to contribute towards the costs of the care of older people.,706,53320,200705
We are opposed to the Harney scheme to appropriate a share of the family home to pay for long-stay care.,706,53320,200705
"Labour believes that we must combine a strong, enterprising and innovative economy,",410,53320,200705
enhancing productivity and value added with robust employment standards,410,53320,200705
and fair terms and conditions of work.,701,53320,200705
"We reject the view that Ireland’s prosperity requires employers to have free access to an unlimited supply of cheap, casualised labour in preference",701,53320,200705
to a strong workforce enjoying collectively agreed terms and conditions of employment.,701,53320,200705
"Across Europe there is a divergence between those who would promote a ‘race to the bottom’ in wages and employment standards,",701,53320,200705
and those who insist on the maintenance of decent terms and conditions of employment and the European social model.,503,53320,200705
"Labour will work to maintain the European social model, not as an alternative to,",701,53320,200705
but as a foundation for an economy which is moving up the value chain and creating more and better jobs.,410,53320,200705
We must ensure that Ireland does not build the next phase of its economic development on the basis of a low wage economy.,701,53320,200705
Economic growth results from a combination of both greater numbers in employment,410,53320,200705
and higher productivity per employee.,408,53320,200705
"Ireland must seek a balance between the prevention of labour shortages,",701,53320,200705
"which might create damaging bottlenecks in the economy, and the wholesale casualisation of labour .",701,53320,200705
The latter poses the risk of an increased reliance on an exploited immigrant workforce,701,53320,200705
"and the consequent driving down of wages, particularly for less skilled employments.",701,53320,200705
"We should seek to develop a Labour market where job security is enhanced through investment in people and their skills,",411,53320,200705
and through policies which ensure that people made redundant retain a higher proportion of their earnings,410,53320,200705
and are facilitated in rapidly finding new jobs.,410,53320,200705
A fair society does not treat immigrant workers as an end in themselves.,705,53320,200705
"Newcomers to Ireland have the same entitlement to dignity, family life, education, accommodation and other essential services as Irish nationals do.",705,53320,200705
"If we are to lay the foundations for an equitable and inclusive society,",705,53320,200705
it is important that we adopt a holistic approach to immigration and the needs of a more diverse population.,705,53320,200705
People working in Ireland are entitled to fair and rigorously enforced terms and conditions of employment.,701,53320,200705
Develop and extend the Registered Employment Agreements model which gives binding status to wage agreements reached at sectoral and employment level.,701,53320,200705
Better resource the Labour Inspectorate,701,53320,200705
and ensure more effective enforcement and prosecution of offences.,701,53320,200705
Ensure targeted enforcement,701,53320,200705
and Revenue inspections of the bogus subcontractor and agency worker issue in the construction sector.,701,53320,200705
Insist that contractors working for local authorities and other public bodies meet minimum labour standards.,701,53320,200705
Create a right for self-employed individuals who enter into or work under contracts “personally to execute any work or labour” to join trade unions,701,53320,200705

"Support the EU Temporary Workers Agency Directive, up to now opposed by the Irish government.",701,53320,200705
Make permanent provisions to protect against the displacement of workers as envisaged in the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007.,701,53320,200705
"In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, we will restore the original spirit of the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 through legislation and procedural change.",701,53320,200705
Support measures at EU level to ensure that minimum labour standards are applied in all ships that commence and end their journeys in the European Union.,701,53320,200705
"Eliminate the “sub-minimum” wage, by the removal of exemptions on the minimum wage based on age, except in the case of apprenticeships.",701,53320,200705
Ensure the collection of better data on labour market conditions.,701,53320,200705
Ratify the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and enshrine its protections in our domestic laws.,701,53320,200705

Too many hard working families encounter obstacles in achieving their preferred work-life balance.,701,53320,200705
Labour believes that there should be a greater element of choice in how families combine the need to earn a living with the need to care for others.,701,53320,200705
Women in particular should not be penalised when they avail of flexible working options.,706,53320,200705
"Bring in new laws providing for workplace flexibility and part-time, flexi-time and jobshare working.",701,53320,200705

"Elsewhere in this document, we set out our proposals to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the pensions issue, to ensure that everyone has an adequate income in old age.",706,53320,200705
■  Review our pensions system.,706,53320,200705
"The social partners, through the National Economic and Social Council will be entrusted with the task of agreeing a new system of pensions, both for the public and private sectors and for stateprovided pensions, to take account of the fact that most people will have a number of jobs during their time in the workforce and many will have multiple pensions by retirement age.",405,53320,200705
The resulting proposals will feed into a new generation of Social Partnership talks to address the pensions issue specifically.,405,53320,200705
Ensure easy transferability of pensions between employers and between pension providers and allow for easy amalgamation of multiple pensions.,706,53320,200705
Protect the pension rights of employees working in firms that are sold as going concerns.,706,53320,200705
"In future, the purchaser of an existing company will be required to take on responsibility for the pension entitlements of the existing employees and the state of the pension fund at the time of purchase.",706,53320,200705
Labour believes that immigration to Ireland is a positive development that both enhances economic growth by alleviating labour shortages and also enriches Irish society through the contribution of people from other cultures to our national life.,705,53320,200705
"But it is clear that immigration is being encouraged by some not because it is of value in itself, but simply because it is feeding the perceived needs of our economy.",705,53320,200705
"However, this risks fostering low pay and poor conditions, a form of exploitation which immigrants themselves are most likely to experience.",705,53320,200705
It is therefore vital that people coming to Ireland to work should enjoy the same terms and conditions of employment as Irish workers.,705,53320,200705
"Furthermore, people who come to Ireland to work need and are entitled to housing, transport and health care.",705,53320,200705
"They are also entitled to live with their families, including dependent children and dependent relatives.",705,53320,200705
A flexible Green Card system will apply to all immigrants from non-EEA countries.,705,53320,200705
Such a new immigration initiative will be based on a real assessment of our labour market requirements and could be adapted from time to time as circumstances change.,705,53320,200705
Work visa allocation will be based on an ongoing assessment of the needs of the Irish labour market.,705,53320,200705
"The occupation, education and language skills of applicants will be considered as criteria for issuing these visas within national quotas.",705,53320,200705
"Work visas will entitle immigrants to work in our country legally and immediately upon arrival, for a fixed number of years.",705,53320,200705
Bureaucracy and administration will be reduced to a minimum.,705,53320,200705
"Immigration for the purpose of family reunion will be facilitated, so that the number of immigrants in employment is recognised as carrying with it an additional number of dependent non-nationals who will have an entitlement to residence in Ireland with a wage-earning family member.",705,53320,200705
Family reunification is one of the most pressing concerns of non-nationals living in Ireland.,705,53320,200705
"As such, the provisions that govern this entitlement will be spelled out in primary legislation rather than ministerial orders or practice guidelines.",705,53320,200705
"The ability to attract overseas students is, amongst other things, a market opportunity.",705,53320,200705
The salability of the product is dependent on adequate prevailing standards.,705,53320,200705
Rogue educational institutions and exploitative employers can only undermine the potential for growth in this area.,705,53320,200705
"We will enforce standards through regular inspections of educational institutions that target overseas students, whether in the public or private sector.",705,53320,200705
"Students from overseas attending accredited institutions will be free to work to finance their studies, just as their Irish peers do.",705,53320,200705
We will grant leave to stay to the small number of aged-out minors who remain in this country.,705,53320,200705
"Although the number of asylum seekers has greatly reduced, real problems remain.",201,53320,200705
There is a huge disparity between the numbers granted refugee status at the initial stage and the numbers successful at the appeal stage.,201,53320,200705
This raises questions as to the soundness of the initial procedures.,201,53320,200705
Inconsistencies and flaws in the decision-making process lead to expensive court actions and delays.,201,53320,200705
The process requires urgent overhaul to bring it into line with best European and international practice.,201,53320,200705
Labour in government will ensure the following rights and guarantees for asylum-seekers:,201,53320,200705
The right to an appropriate interpreter.,201,53320,200705
The right to an oral hearing before a decision is made.,201,53320,200705
That decision-makers behave sensitively and are properly qualified and trained and have adequate information about the country of origin.,201,53320,200705
That effective and resourced representation is available to all asylum seekers.,201,53320,200705
That time limits relating to the application are fair and not oppressive to the asylum seeker,201,53320,200705
That unaccompanied minors applying for asylum should have a legal guardian appointed to represent them in an appropriate manner.,201,53320,200705
"Restricting the grounds upon which applicants may be rejected as “manifestly unfounded”, to bring Ireland more into line with the UNHCR and the EU Council of Ministers’ resolution.",201,53320,200705
That the standard of decision-making be improved by independent and objective performance review.,201,53320,200705
Planning for a fair and efficient immigration system involves more than devising rules and procedures.,607,53320,200705
"The significant number of immigrants arriving in Ireland prompts the need for a range of services, including accommodation, training and language courses.",607,53320,200705
"Labour in government will take lead responsibility in this area from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has entirely legitimate concerns of its own but which is not best equipped to meet the demands of social integration, and transfer it to another government department.",607,53320,200705
We will also introduce more relevant and meaningful citizenship ceremonies when people are awarded citizenship of Ireland.,607,53320,200705
"Even after more than a decade of rapid growth, poverty is still a reality.",503,53320,200705
Why is it that Ireland has one of the most unequal distributions of income in the industrialised world?,503,53320,200705
Or that one in nine children live in poverty?,503,53320,200705
"Why are the poor still likely to be children of the poor, / caught in the poverty trap set by poor education, low-skilled jobs and unemployment?",503,53320,200705
"While poverty exists in every corner of Ireland, there are also particular areas where there are strong concentrations of poverty and disadvantage, / leading to a particularly acute experience of poverty for the families and communities concerned.",503,53320,200705
"These are areas where significant pockets of chronic, persistent unemployment coexist with buoyant national labour markets.",503,53320,200705
One in three children in some disadvantaged schools has severe literacy and numeracy difficulties – ten times the national average.,503,53320,200705
School drop-out rates in some parts of the capital are as high as 60 per cent.,503,53320,200705
"Life expectancy in severely deprived communities is lower and the incidence of chronic ill health, including mental ill health, higher.",503,53320,200705
"In these severely disadvantaged communities, families struggle with the combined burden of poverty, crime, low educational attainment, unemployment, drugs, over-stretched services, poor housing and health problems.",503,53320,200705
"Despite progress in improving social welfare payment rates, absolute poverty is still a reality,",503,53320,200705
"with social welfare payments often falling short of what is needed to make ends meet, and relative poverty rates remain high by European standards.",503,53320,200705
"Furthermore, Social Welfare rules include perverse disincentives to re-train, take up employment or even co-parent.",411,53320,200705
The safety net of social welfare can become a trap from which it makes no financial sense to escape.,503,53320,200705
"Some groups in our society are particularly vulnerable, including one-parent families, the elderly, and those working on low incomes.",503,53320,200705
The concept of equality is built on the idea that everyone should be able to develop their potential to the full.,503,53320,200705
"Too often in our society, human potential is unnecessarily and arbitrarily held back through poverty and disadvantage.",503,53320,200705
"Equality is not achieved by a state that stands back, and allows each individual to find their own way, but through proactive policies designed to allow each individual to realise their full potential.",503,53320,200705
"As a society, we must ensure that, working together, we spread the opportunities of modern Ireland to all our people.",503,53320,200705
Labour’s approach to tackling inequality and poverty is based on a combination of four elements,503,53320,200705
Continuing to enhance the adequacy of social welfare payments,504,53320,200705
Reform of social welfare to remove poverty traps / and to improve the position of some of those at highest risk of poverty,504,53320,200705
Our Fair Deal Commitment for areas of multiple disadvantage,503,53320,200705
"Better services, especially in health and education, to improve quality of life, and to give people a springboard for a better future.",504,53320,200705
Many of the meaningful changes in the Irish social welfare system have happened under Labour Party guidance and initiative.,503,53320,200705
"While recent budgets have seen significant improvements in social welfare payment rates, which Labour has welcomed, little has been done to modernise the social welfare system to recognise the changes in families, in the role of women, and the nature of work.",503,53320,200705
"Despite having the opportunity to do so, the present government has not been willing to engage in real social welfare reform to tackle the problem of poverty traps and persistent poverty and inequality.",503,53320,200705
Our proposals for social welfare reform are set out using the life cycle approach adopted by the social partners.,503,53320,200705
"In the context of developing policy on support for families with children, including the early years subsidy, FIS and CDAs, we will examine reform options including a supplementary child benefit.",504,53320,200705
"We will substantially improve rates of payment under the Back to School allowance scheme, introduct a once-off payment for children entering second level education and review the income limits.",504,53320,200705
This government says we have full employment and only 4.2 per cent unemployment but over half a million working aged people are trapped on social welfare unable to live life or contribute to their full potential.,503,53320,200705
We will maximise their opportunity for employment while at the same time ensuring the social welfare system is an effective safety net for those who cannot work or cannot find work.,503,53320,200705
Social welfare payments are still not enough to lift people out of poverty.,504,53320,200705
As resources allow we will make real increases in social welfare payments.,504,53320,200705
"Over time, we will replace the Rent Allowance scheme with a new form of housing support for public and private rental accommodation, which also covers those working on low incomes.",504,53320,200705
As a short-term measure we will increase the disregards and rent thresholds that apply in the existing scheme.,504,53320,200705
Improve the system of retention of secondary benefits for people who take up work.,504,53320,200705
"We will restructure support for one-parent families, to enable those parenting alone meet their caring obligations, support themselves in work and, if they choose, form sustainable relationships.",504,53320,200705
Promote equality for women in the social welfare system by beginnng to phase out the limitation rule and the concept of qualified adult.,503,53320,200705
We will make the social welfare service more relevant to the needs of working mothers’ employment patterns by reviewing the ‘actively seeking work’ guidelines to facilitate part-time working.,504,53320,200705
"Consistent with our commitment to reform FÁS, we will also examine the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure it has the capacity to meet the demands of a modern society.",411,53320,200705
Ensure that work pays through examination of how social welfare income interacts with paid work.,504,53320,200705
Ensure that the obligations of people of working age to seek work are met by the State with the appropriate levels of support.,504,53320,200705
We will review the supplementary welfare allowance urgent needs payments and develop a low cost credit scheme for those on social welfare or low incomes.,504,53320,200705
"While much is said about the contribution of older people to the foundations of our modern economy, less is done in real terms to value and reward that contribution.",504,53320,200705
We will raise the level of the State non-Contributory pension to €300 by 2012.,706,53320,200705
"We will progressively increase contributory old age pension qualified adult payments towards the same level as the adult rate, and pay them directly to the qualified adult.",706,53320,200705
We will allow non-contributory pensioners to earn money from self-employment as well as employment without affecting their pension.,706,53320,200705
We will recognise the real contribution made by older women near or at pension age to both the Irish economy and society by progressively making home care credits retrospective to 1973.,705,53320,200705
Those who are depending on receiving care and those who provide that care are often the most vulnerable in our society.,705,53320,200705
It is no surprise that many of this group are women.,706,53320,200705
We will introduce a cost of disability allowance.,705,53320,200705
Abolish the means test for carers.,705,53320,200705
Examine how to ensure that women who take time out to care for others do not suffer pension poverty in later years.,706,53320,200705
"Labour believes that the time has come to put in place a comprehensive pensions policy framework to ensure that all older people have an adequate retirement income, through a combination of social welfare and personal/occupational pensions.",706,53320,200705
"■  Request that the social partners, working through the National Economic and Social Council, prepare a blueprint document for a comprehensive settlement of the pensions issue.",405,53320,200705
"We will place that document before the next round of pay negotiations, and move rapidly to an implementation phase.",405,53320,200705
"■  We believe this settlement should provide for automatic pensions deductions for all employees, with an opt-out option.",504,53320,200705
"Every employee will have a pension contribution made from their pay packet, but will have the option to sign a form saying that they do not wish to make that contribution.",504,53320,200705
"Where a person is not part of a company pension scheme, the automatic voluntary contribution would be paid into a personal defined-contribution pension product.",504,53320,200705
■  A major push to expand this kind of pensions coverage demands that the state ensures that people have reasonably priced pensions products available to them.,403,53320,200705
"The pensions industry in Ireland continues to be characterised by obscure charging regimes, and there are real difficulties for consumers in identifying who is charging what so that they can compare pensions products.",403,53320,200705
We need further reform to address these issues.,403,53320,200705
"■  In addition, the state acting though the NTMA, should provide access to a basic personal pension product or products.",504,53320,200705
"This should be structured among the lines of an SSIA, where contributions and state top-ups are clearly visible.",504,53320,200705
This would be the default option for the automatic voluntary deduction.,504,53320,200705
It would of course be open to people to pay their contributions to a private sector provider.,504,53320,200705
"The NTMA could charge a fair, modest and transparent fee for its services.",504,53320,200705
"■  While this approach will improve the income of future pensioners, it will not address poverty among older people at present.",503,53320,200705
We believe the solution is to introduce a minimum income guarantee for today’s pensioners.,706,53320,200705
This would provide a top-up pension payment to those whose income falls below a minimum level.,706,53320,200705
■  The state will be required to continue incentivisation of personal pensions provision in the future.,402,53320,200705
"There is a need, however, to impose more rigorous limits to prevent the use of pension schemes for wholesale tax avoidance.",503,53320,200705
■  There is a need to examine pensions legislation to ensure easy transferability of pensions between employers and between pension providers and allow for easy amalgamation of multiple pensions.,701,53320,200705
It is also important to protect the pension rights of employees working in firms that are sold as going concerns.,701,53320,200705
"Defined benefit schemes, where they exist, should be sustained.",701,53320,200705
■  We will sympathetically examine the idea of a state annuity scheme.,504,53320,200705
"Chronically deprived communities need a coordinated programme of investment in all aspects of life in these areas, including education, health, the built environment, policing and childcare.",504,53320,200705
"Coupled with social welfare reform, this amounts to a major, cross-departmental ‘Marshall Plan’ for what we call Fair Deal Communities.",504,53320,200705
"This programme can be delivered through the National Development Plan by prioritising and ringfencing investment in these areas in a determined, co-ordinated, whole-of-government approach.",504,53320,200705
■  Use existing structures to replace the RAPID programmes with a Fair Deal for Communities initiative.,504,53320,200705
■  Draw on small/local area census data to compile accurate deprivation indexes to help and delimit Fair Deal communities.,504,53320,200705
"■  Secure a transparent, multi-annual funding formula for the Fair Deal initiatives.",504,53320,200705
■  Require all relevant government departments and agencies to clearly earmark and ring-fence not less than 5 per cent of NDP capital funds for Fair Deal communities.,504,53320,200705
■  Incorporate strong ex post evaluative and accountability rules within the framework of reformed public financial procedures.,303,53320,200705
"■  Put renewed emphasis on strategic direction from the centre and locally based, targeted active labour market initiatives and local employment/placement services in Fair Deal communities and neighbourhoods.",303,53320,200705
■  Prioritise Fair Deal communities in the deployment of additional community Gardai and the development of local community policing structures.,504,53320,200705
"Like poverty, educational disadvantage is to be found in every corner of Ireland, but is also concentrated in particular areas of cumulative disadvantage.",506,53320,200705
We want to develop a system which allocates resources based on the cumulative ‘weight’ of disadvantage of the schools’ pupils.,506,53320,200705
"Thus the most disadvantaged schools will still receive the most support, while schools with ‘pockets’ of disadvantage within their catchments will also receive necessary resources to address their needs.",506,53320,200705
We also believe that school principals should have greater flexibility in applying resources to meet the needs of their particular school and area.,506,53320,200705
"■  Adequately resource the National Educational Psychologist Service to ensure that children get assessed quickly, and thus have access to the learning support they need.",506,53320,200705
"■  Provide well-equipped, family-friendly school libraries which could have the potential to offer community-based family literacy schemes.",502,53320,200705
"■  Encourage local authorities to promote better literacy, through homework clubs, longer opening hours for libraries, and better design and standards in local authority housing – the ideas promoted by the Right to Read Campaign.",506,53320,200705
"■  Enable pre-school centres and schools to adopt special teaching programmes such as High/Scope and the Incredible Years programme,",506,53320,200705
aimed at educating parents in the skills of parenthood and targeting children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulty (EBD) in school and at home.,506,53320,200705
■  Adequately resource the NEWB to allow it to fulfil its national mandate under the Education and Welfare Act 2000.,506,53320,200705
■  The Board will also be mandated to prioritise Fair Deal communities and neighbourhoods and to actively engage with other agencies such as FÁS and the HSE and community representatives in the area implementation planning structures.,504,53320,200705
■  In respect of primary education we will provide the most disadvantaged primary schools with a comprehensive package of supports.,506,53320,200705
Low levels of education and skills are primary drivers of low incomes and inter-generational poverty.,503,53320,200705
"Labour is committed to reform of Ireland’s skills and training structures, with the twin aims of enhancing productivity",410,53320,200705
and promoting social solidarity.,606,53320,200705
"Central to this objective is that of reducing the numbers who leave school without Leaving Cert equivalent qualifications, and raising the educational attainment of those who have already left school with inadequate qualifications.",506,53320,200705
■  Mandate the NEWB to track all 16-18 year olds who leave school without a Leaving Certificate.,506,53320,200705
■  Develop a social guarantee so that all early school leavers (16-18 years old) will be offered a place in meaningful and appropriate education or training.,506,53320,200705
"Drug use is an escalating social problem in Ireland characterised by poly-drug use, violence and gun crime, alcohol abuse and anti-social behaviour.",504,53320,200705
"The numbers of young people experimenting with drugs in our towns, villages and cities is growing at an alarming rate.",504,53320,200705
"Having previously been confined mainly to Dublin, in the last decade heroin has spread to every county in Ireland.",504,53320,200705
"Poly-drug use is increasingly becoming a reality, while drug and criminal networks are in place nationwide.",504,53320,200705
"The National Drugs Strategy is effectively at a standstill, as the fulfilment of their 100 promises under the strategy remains behind schedule.",504,53320,200705
The Labour Party is still broadly supportive of the principles and objectives of the National Drugs Strategy.,504,53320,200705
"However, we believe that it is imperative that the changing nature of the drugs problem in this country is addressed.",504,53320,200705
This is particularly urgent as we come to the end of the 2001-2008 National Drugs Strategy and begin to prepare a successor strategy.,504,53320,200705
The political will of the present government to fight the problem of substance abuse has clearly evaporated.,504,53320,200705
Labour in government will give renewed impetus to the fight against drugs as conceived in the National Drugs Strategy.,504,53320,200705
"By re-focusing and reassessing our approach to the drugs crisis, Labour will ensure that the National Drugs Strategy will remain relevant and effective and will provide a long-term solution to our drug crisis.",504,53320,200705
■  Invest the National Drugs Strategy with fresh political will and impetus.,504,53320,200705
"■  Implement in full the national drugs strategy (NDS) 2001–2008, fast track the implementation of all remaining actions in that plan and as a priority, prepare a successor strategy.",504,53320,200705
■  Build on local community policing structures in line with stated Labour community policing and police reform policy.,504,53320,200705
■  Expand rehabilitation services at local level in line with need.,504,53320,200705
"Provide adequate funding for Community based drug projects like Merchants Quay and SAOL, North-West Training and Development Programme and Aftercare Recovery Group.",504,53320,200705
■  Alcohol abuse and drug abuse are increasingly interlinked.,504,53320,200705
"In the 14 local drug task force (LDTF) areas we will integrate drug and alcohol abuse strategies, Poly-drug use also needs to be addressed by local drug task forces.",504,53320,200705
■  Integrate substance abuse strategies with active labour market and local area renewal policies as elucidated in Labour’s policy document A Fair Deal to give a new sense of community and community renewal to the drug epidemic black spots.,504,53320,200705
"■  Strengthen the supply reduction effort and criminal asset seizures, particularly at the local level.",605,53320,200705
"■  Develop through, for example an expanded system of drug courts, compulsory as well as voluntary rehabilitation programmes.",605,53320,200705
"■  Work to ensure that our prisons are drug-free rather than, as at present, drug dens.",605,53320,200705
■  A special task force should respond immediately to the arrival of new illicit drugs.,504,53320,200705
They should be specifically targeted with a view to swiftly identifying the source of supply and eliminating it.,504,53320,200705
Irish democracy is not in good shape.,202,53320,200705
The national hangover caused by corruption in local and national government has yet to fade.,304,53320,200705
We are further and further removed from how our tax contributions are spent.,302,53320,200705
"We are frustrated by the incapacity of an inflexible, centralised government to respond fast enough to real-life problems.",202,53320,200705
"As a result, citizens have disengaged from politics in large numbers.",202,53320,200705
"At the same time, massive budgetary increases and the growing complexity of a globalised world mean that the need for accountability in government has never been greater.",202,53320,200705
Yet we are stuck with 19th Century systems of administration to oversee and manage a 21st century country.,303,53320,200705
"To take just one example, the Dáil is meant to oversee government spending and to check projects for ‘value-for-money’.",303,53320,200705
"But the Dáil’s spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, operates under a timescale whereby, in 2007, it will spend its time examining government accounts showing how money was spent two years ago, in 2005.",303,53320,200705
A major challenge is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure programmes.,303,53320,200705
"Because Labour champions public service provision, we also champion public service effectiveness and efficiency.",303,53320,200705
This is not code for public spending cuts.,303,53320,200705
Effectiveness simply means the degree of success of a programme in meeting its objectives.,303,53320,200705
And efficiency means the delivery of services at least cost in terms of resources used.,303,53320,200705
There is an ‘efficiency dividend’ to be reaped from reducing waste in the public sector.,303,53320,200705
That dividend will be reinvested and will be used to deliver better public services.,303,53320,200705
"Labour also insists that public administration must be informed by the principles of openness, transparency and accountability.",303,53320,200705
"These are not burdensome principles, designed to slow down or sidetrack the public service.",303,53320,200705
They are the best and indeed only means of ensuring that citizens get all necessary information to assess whether best practice is being followed and whether value for money is being sought and delivered.,202,53320,200705
We are convinced that the only effective and efficient government is one that is open and honest.,202,53320,200705
The current system dates from a more leisurely age and has failed to keep up with the demands of a modern state and,303,53320,200705
with the citizens’ right to know how decisions are taken on their behalf.,303,53320,200705
"We need radical changes to the structures and systems of administration, financial management and government accountability.",202,53320,200705
Restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before it was filleted by the present government.,201,53320,200705
We will also implement all the recommendations for reform of the Act made by the Information Commissioner.,201,53320,200705
"We will extend the remit of the Act – and the remit of the Ombudsman Act – to the Garda Síochána, the Central Bank and many other statutory bodies, and bodies significantly funded from the public purse, that are currently excluded.",201,53320,200705
Introduce Whistleblowers’ Protection legislation to protect those in public service who bring maladministration to light.,201,53320,200705
"Propose a referendum to reverse the constitutional amendment on Cabinet confidentiality, to ensure that the current almost absolute protection cannot be used to cover up necessary investigations.",201,53320,200705
"Repeal the Official Secrets Act, retaining a criminal sanction only for breaches which involve serious threats such as a threat to the international relations of the state, the conduct of a fair trial, or national security.",204,53320,200705
A public interest defence will be available in such cases.,201,53320,200705
"Where the government relies in the Dáil on legal advice received from the Attorney General, as its reason for proposing or refusing to accept legislation, we will ensure that, subject to normal considerations of commercial confidence, national security and so on, summaries of the Attorney General’s advice to government are made and published.",202,53320,200705
Introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and a statutory code governing the practice of lobbying.,304,53320,200705
Bring in rules to ensure that senior public servants (including political appointees) cannot work in the private sector in an area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment until at least two years has elapsed since their departure from the public service.,304,53320,200705
"Review the law on spending by political parties with a view to developing a more rigorous system, including spending limits for local and presidential elections, and to widen the time frames to which the spending ceilings for European and general elections apply.",304,53320,200705
"Given that it is not constitutionally feasible to abolish outright donations to political organisations,",203,53320,200705
"we will introduce legislation to restrict contributions to political parties and candidates to €2,500 and €1,000 respectively, and to require disclosure of all aggregate sums above €1,500 and €600 respectively.",304,53320,200705
Introduce a package of changes to bring about a 50 per cent increase in Dáil sitting days.,202,53320,200705
Dáil Éireann will in future meet four days a week when in session and working hours will be significantly extended.,202,53320,200705
There will be a summer recess of just six weeks and significantly reduced breaks at Christmas and Easter.,202,53320,200705
We will abandon the practice of providing a “mid-term break” – a full week off at St Patrick’s Day and Hallowe’en.,202,53320,200705
"Amend Cabinet procedures to require the general scheme of a Bill to be published as soon as it is approved by government, so that Oireachtas committees can debate and hold hearings on Bills at the earliest stage.",202,53320,200705
Undertake a complete redrafting and updating of Dáil Standing Orders.,202,53320,200705
Confer on the Ceann Comhairle a specific responsibility for ensuring that the interests of all members and the public interest are fully and fairly protected.,202,53320,200705
Oblige Ministers to ensure that questions are answered properly and fully (including an obligation to correct matters if the House is misled).,202,53320,200705
"Allow for “same day” discussion of urgent or topical matters, especially those involving a wide public interest.",202,53320,200705
Restrict the use of guillotine motions and other procedural devices that prevent Bills from being fully debated.,202,53320,200705
"Allow far more interchange between members and make it obligatory on members, including Ministers, to “yield” to reasonable interventions and questions from the floor.",202,53320,200705
"Reform procedures for dealing with legislation, to allow more time for debate and participation at every stage.",202,53320,200705
Private Members Time will be extended to include government as well as opposition deputies.,202,53320,200705
All TDs will be entitled to put forward proposals for legislation and a lottery at the start of each session will determine which Bills will be debated.,202,53320,200705
Party whips should be relaxed on such occasions.,202,53320,200705
"Extend Question Time, to increase the number of questions to be answered and debated in the Chamber and to allow written questions to be submitted directly to state agencies.",202,53320,200705
"In addition, written questions will be asked and answered during Dáil recesses.",202,53320,200705
Significantly expand the work of Oireachtas committees dealing with scrutiny of EU legislation and regulations made by ministers.,202,53320,200705
"Following on the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara Inquiry case, we will, if necessary, propose an amendment to the Constitution to ensure the Dáil is enabled to inquire into and report on any exercise of the executive power of the state or in relation to the administration of any public service.",202,53320,200705
"■  We will establish an Oireachtas Committee of Investigations, Oversight and Petitions.",202,53320,200705
The committee will be bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a member of the opposition.,202,53320,200705
Ensure consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and the Ombudsman.,202,53320,200705
Receive parliamentary petitions seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services and with public administration generally.,202,53320,200705
Arrange investigation of issues of urgent public importance which demand detailed and thorough investigation.,202,53320,200705
Supervise an Office of Parliamentary Investigator.,202,53320,200705
The Office of Parliamentary Investigator will have responsibility for ensuring the timely and cost effective investigation of issues giving rise to significant public concern.,202,53320,200705
"Persons would be appointed from time to time to this office, on the basis of specific contracts, to carry out specific investigations.",202,53320,200705
The Investigator will perform functions similar to those carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.,202,53320,200705
"The Investigator will have powers to require witnesses to attend and answer questions and to disclose and produce documents, together with power to enter premises and to take copies of documents.",202,53320,200705
"Evidence would be taken in private, as is done by Commissions of Investigation.",202,53320,200705
"The written reports of the Investigator on matters of established fact would be used as the basis for further investigation, by Oireachtas committees or by tribunals.",202,53320,200705
"Labour has published a detailed document entitled The Buck Stops Here, setting out a comprehensive set of proposals to end the waste of public funds that has characterised this government and to ensure the delivery of better, more efficient and effective public services.",303,53320,200705
Our Constitution requires the government to prepare Estimates of the receipts and expenditure of the state for each financial year and to present them to the Dáil.,303,53320,200705
The Dáil is then required to “consider” those Estimates.,303,53320,200705
"Real and effective Dáil scrutiny, on behalf of the taxpayer, needs two things:",303,53320,200705
A reliable and easily understood budgeting process that sets out the financial consequences of policies the government proposes to implement.,303,53320,200705
"A reliable and easily understood reporting (or management accounting) process, that sets out the consequences of the policies actually implemented.",303,53320,200705
"Labour in government will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant.",303,53320,200705
It will in future start at the beginning of the preceding year and conclude by the summer.,303,53320,200705
The annual Estimates will in future distinguish between monies being allocated to maintaining the existing level of service for existing programmes and money to support new programmes or policy decisions.,303,53320,200705
Proposals for new expenditure programmes will be accompanied by a five-year projection of costs and benefits.,303,53320,200705
"The Estimates will also distinguish between discretionary and non-discretionary spending, i.e., spending arising from legal entitlements which must be met (such as pensions).",303,53320,200705
The Book of Estimates will be accompanied by a detailed performance report on what the previous year’s spending had achieved.,303,53320,200705
It will also give details of the level of performance achieved by agencies under service delivery agreements with government.,303,53320,200705
Improved services for Oireachtas members will include dedicated resources for the proper scrutiny of the Estimates.,303,53320,200705
"An Estimates Commissioner, with strong powers, will be appointed within the Houses of the Oireachtas to manage the advance scrutiny of spending proposals, in the same way that the Comptroller and Auditor General scrutinises the outcome of spending after the event.",303,53320,200705
We will introduce a new basic law for government departments and the civil service.,303,53320,200705
"The legislation will specify the roles, functions, powers and duties of departments and the position of the minister in charge of each department.",303,53320,200705
"The new legislation will provide for a clear line of authority, responsibility and command.",303,53320,200705
"It will permit only the specific delegation of specific powers to civil servants, instead of the current practice of implied blanket delegation of all ministerial powers to all his or her civil servants, capable of being exercised without the minister’s knowledge or authority.",303,53320,200705
"Civil servants exercising delegated ministerial powers will be, to the extent of the authority delegated to them, accountable both within the department and also directly and publicly accountable to the Dáil.",303,53320,200705
"Ministers will become responsible in law for the supervision and oversight of their departments, as well as for their own direct actions.",303,53320,200705
"The law will clarify the authority, responsibilities and accountabilities of Secretaries General of government departments.",303,53320,200705
We will replace the existing rules which severely restrict civil servants in their answers to Dáil Committees with a system which reflects the reality of responsibility delegated to civil servants,303,53320,200705
"We will keep clear records of the decisions made by ministers personally, so that there can be no subsequent conflict, confusion or denial of responsibility on such basic matters.",303,53320,200705
We will make ministers accountable to the Dáil for the adequacy of their oversight of all the agencies and public bodies under their remit.,303,53320,200705
We will enhance the capacity of the civil service by:,303,53320,200705
Introducing open recruitment for senior public service Positions.,303,53320,200705
Introducing greater professionalisation of key functions.,303,53320,200705
Equipping senior managers with a wider range of skills,303,53320,200705
Linking performance pay schemes to high level targets.,303,53320,200705
Expanding civil service training and education opportunities.,506,53320,200705
Strengthening the internal audit function and augmenting its legal capacity.,303,53320,200705
"Labour believes that the best people to plan and manage local services, such as planning for the environment and housing, the amenities that make our local community work, the schools which teach our children, transport and traffic matters, policing, care of the young and of the elderly, should be the locals who use them.",301,53320,200705
"In most European countries, these everyday matters are the concerns and functions of a strong system of local government.",301,53320,200705
"Education, health, policing, transport and traffic are normally delivered and overseen by city, county, regional and local authorities.",301,53320,200705
Ireland has one of the weakest systems of local government in the European Union.,301,53320,200705
Local ‘government’ does not exist in Ireland.,301,53320,200705
"At best, we have a system of “Local Administration”,",301,53320,200705
"through which centrally appointed managers make the executive decisions for our cities, counties and towns.",301,53320,200705
All this leaves the individual citizen feeling powerless in his or her own city or county.,301,53320,200705
The net result of Ireland’s unique approach to local governance is that the quality of local services is often poor.,202,53320,200705
"The system by which Ireland provides local services is excessively bureaucratic, confused and costly and the citizen finds it difficult to get access to the real decision makers.",202,53320,200705
The lack of accountability results in the unelected management of local authorities being too powerful and the lack of real power for elected councillors is leading to decreased public confidence in local government.,202,53320,200705
Many providers of public services are not accountable at all at local level,202,53320,200705
Labour will deliver a major reform of local government and devolve further functions from the national to the regional and local levels under new structures to ensure democratic management of these services.,301,53320,200705
"Labour will strengthen the role of the elected council, in order to provide the citizen with accountable public services.",301,53320,200705
"Councillors will have power to seek accountability from any agency, whether public or private, which is providing public services in their area.",301,53320,200705
"Councillors will have power to seek reports from service providers and to question, in public, the appropriate managers on aspects of their service.",301,53320,200705
Councils will also have a consumer protection role in relation to private sector services.,202,53320,200705
"Private refuse collectors, telecoms, private schools, local banks and cable TV providers will be amenable to public questioning by the elected representatives of the people, on their public service remit.",202,53320,200705
Local government in Ireland needs to be remapped.,301,53320,200705
The remapping will be based on the wishes of the people and will be preceded by public consultation.,301,53320,200705
"There will be two levels of local government: Regional Authorities, which will include City Authorities for the larger cities,",301,53320,200705
"and Local Authorities, which will include County, Town and District Councils.",301,53320,200705
"Strategic Planning: a democratically decided Regional or City Plan will replace Strategic Planning Guidelines, which are now handed down by the department",301,53320,200705
Implementation of national spatial strategies,301,53320,200705
Transport and traffic,301,53320,200705
Economic development including Employment Services,301,53320,200705
Other functions to be devolved over time.,301,53320,200705
"Local Authorities will be given, in addition to their existing core responsibilities, a new range of devolved functions together with the finance and resources needed to carry out these new roles.",301,53320,200705
"We will establish a Dublin Regional Authority, which will have overall responsibility for the running of the city and the three Dublin counties.",301,53320,200705
"It will be responsible for transport and traffic, strategic planning, protection of Dublin Bay and for overseeing the services which are delivered Dublin wide.",301,53320,200705
"The members of the DRA will be directly elected, headed by a directly elected mayor of Dublin.",301,53320,200705
"The current Dublin City Council and the three county councils will be replaced over time by 1012 District Councils, based on populations of approximately 100,000, each of which will have the status of a County Council.",301,53320,200705
"City Authorities will be established for the other larger cities in the country,",301,53320,200705
and Regional Authorities will be established for different regions of the country.,301,53320,200705
Devolution of powers will take time.,301,53320,200705
The first responsibility to be devolved to these Regional and City Authorities will be transport.,301,53320,200705
"One of the first regional bodies to be set up will be for the “ATM region” – Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.",301,53320,200705
Respecting the principle of subsidiarity the distinction between County Councils and the larger Town Councils will be ended.,301,53320,200705
All such councils will have the same status.,301,53320,200705
"There will be options available to people as to the type of Council which would exist in a particular area, as between County Councils,Town Councils and District Councils.",301,53320,200705
"Where a dispute arises over the inclusion of an area in a council, the issue will be resolved by plebiscite of the voters in that area.",301,53320,200705
The position of County Manager will be abolished and replaced by a Chief Executive of the Council.,202,53320,200705
"Chief Executives will exercise a limited range of executive functions, similar to those which were originally intended in the City and County Management Acts.",202,53320,200705
Chief Executives will have no policy making functions other than to assist and advise the elected Council in the making of policy.,202,53320,200705
The power of the Minister to abolish a Council and to replace it with a Commissioner will be ended.,202,53320,200705
"Instead, where a Council fails to adopt an annual budget, the Council will stand suspended until fresh elections are held to elect a new council for the remainder of its five year cycle.",202,53320,200705
Each Local Authority will have a directly elected mayor for the five year term of the Council.,202,53320,200705
Directly elected mayors in the larger authorities will hold office on a full time basis.,202,53320,200705
The reorganisation and remapping of local government will be achieved without increasing costs.,303,53320,200705
The devolution of powers and functions from the centre will be accompanied by the corresponding finance and resources.,303,53320,200705
"In the longer term, devolution will reduce cost because many of the functions concerned can be performed more effectively at local level.",303,53320,200705
Effective regional and local government must be adequately resourced.,301,53320,200705
"A redistribution of taxes will be defined as between central and local government, based on the funding framework which is already in place for local authorities.",301,53320,200705
"Already some taxes are dedicated for either local government generally, or for services provided through local government.",301,53320,200705
"These include rates on commercial and industrial properties, which are levied and collected by local authorities; the Local government Fund which is based on motor taxation; and the Environment Fund which was established with the tax on plastic.",301,53320,200705
Rates will be levied on state owned commercial property.,0,53320,200705
There is no continuing justification for exempting state owned commercial property from the rates regime which applies to privately owned businesses.,0,53320,200705
"Balanced regional development is in the interests of individuals, families and communities in every region of the country.",301,53320,200705
"Dublin has been the engine of the country’s economic growth, but its current uncontrolled expansion is neither sustainable nor desirable.",301,53320,200705
"Ireland needs a more balanced pattern of development in the interests of fairness, sustainability and competitiveness.",301,53320,200705
The next government must not repeat the mistakes of its predecessors.,301,53320,200705
The chief weakness of the 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) was that it lacked real political commitment across all government departments.,301,53320,200705
"In addition, the scattergun approach of the failed decentralisation policy only served to signal that the government had no intention of implementing its own spatial strategy.",301,53320,200705
The challenge for the next government is to lay the foundation stones of modern regional economies that will be capable of embracing a future where regions and cities compete for investment on an international stage.,301,53320,200705
"This must be supported by national government through guaranteeing universal broadband access, investing in transport infrastructure, ensuring adequate water, gas and electricity supplies and investing in education, research and skills.",411,53320,200705
"Future balanced regional development should be a combination of significant investment in regional urban centres and innovative policies to exploit our natural strengths,",301,53320,200705
"such as our beautiful landscape and high-quality food industry, and to spearhead new industries, such as bioenergy.",301,53320,200705
A strong economic and social counterweight to Dublin which would attract both private investment and a significant proportion of the country’s workforce could only improve Ireland’s competitiveness.,410,53320,200705
"It is time for strong, joined-up leadership from government to close the wealth divide between east and west.",301,53320,200705
"Improved standards of living and vibrant, sustainable communities for all should be more than an aspiration.",416,53320,200705
It should be a priority.,410,53320,200705
"Create a unitary Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to ensure the proper coordination between these related areas of government and to take advantage of increasing payments from the EU’s Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) budget for rural development initiatives.",703,53320,200705
"Reduce by 50 per cent the rates bills of village shops, pubs and/or garages where they are the last one, two or three remaining in their communities.",301,53320,200705
"Develop and resource targeted policies addressing poverty and social exclusion among women in rural Ireland, particularly regarding childcare, training and education.",706,53320,200705
Implement policies that encourage part-time farming.,703,53320,200705
We want a greater share of Ireland’s rural development funding to go on improving the quality of life in rural areas and facilitating the diversification of the rural economy.,703,53320,200705
Find effective ways of ensuring farm spouses’ work on the farm is appropriately recognised by the social welfare system.,703,53320,200705
"Foster, particularly through distance and afterhours learning courses, an ethos of continuing education amongst farming and rural families.",703,53320,200705
We want only products wholly produced here to be labelled as Irish.,403,53320,200705
We will pursue regulatory changes to make this a reality through the EU.,403,53320,200705
"Ensure that whenever necessary changes are implemented to the single farm payment system, no risks are taken with the effective delivery of existing payments to farmers and their families.",703,53320,200705
Review the working of the Agriculture Appeals Office and ensure that it fulfils its duties as effectively as possible.,703,53320,200705
"Maintain farm consolidation support measures, such as continuing provision of stamp duty relief for qualifying farmers under fifty.",703,53320,200705
We will keep raising the thresholds in the leased land exemption scheme.,703,53320,200705
We are committed to ensuring optimal take-up of the Farm Assist and Rural Social Scheme programmes.,703,53320,200705
Work with the European Commission to secure the continuation of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme beyond 2010.,703,53320,200705

Establish a Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment based on consultation with all major stakeholders to be brought before Dail Eireann on an annual basis before EU fisheries negotiations commence.,703,53320,200705

"At  present Ireland only has one city capable of competing with other international cities for certain categories of mobile, high-value added industries.",301,53320,200705
"However, if combined, the populations of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford would provide the critical mass needed to compete with Dublin for investment.",301,53320,200705
These cities could act in concert to form a major focal point of regional development.,301,53320,200705
"Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore could also combine their resources to form a growth centre, as could Sligo and Letterkenny-Derry.",301,53320,200705
An alternative growth pole depends on the cities/counties in question cooperating rather than competing for investment.,301,53320,200705

"The spheres of sport, arts and culture have long been a distinctive part of the fabric of Irish life.",502,53320,200705
In a sense they constitute an important part of who we are as a people.,502,53320,200705
"As a country we are proud of our sporting and cultural achievements, whether at a professional level, where our sportsmen and women and artists, writers and musicians continue to excel on the international stage, or at the amateur level,",502,53320,200705
where the culture of volunteerism is a testimony to the spirit of community that is still alive and well in Irish life.,606,53320,200705
"Nonetheless there is a sense that the sporting, cultural and recreational aspects of life are increasingly under threat.",502,53320,200705
"As our material prosperity increases many of us have less time for sporting, artistic and recreational pursuits.",502,53320,200705
This is particularly evident in the arts.,502,53320,200705
"For a country which prides itself on its musical, literary and artistic heritage, we have extremely low participation rates in cultural pursuits in comparison to our European counterparts.",502,53320,200705
"A recent Eurobarometer survey commissioned by the European Commission, estimated that one in three Irish people never attend a gallery, a museum or a play, or sample a variety of live music.",502,53320,200705
The picture appears to be brighter for sport.,502,53320,200705

"Half a million of us regularly play sport, while 400,000 volunteer as coaches, match officials and referees.",606,53320,200705

"We believe that our common culture and, language and heritage should be protected, not painted as obstacles to progress.",502,53320,200705
"We are also aware, however, that as well as preserving the past, we need to keep a firm eye on the future.",502,53320,200705
"As a country we need to be prepared for the huge shifts in the cultural landscape which are set to take place in the coming years, particularly in the area of digital broadcasting.",502,53320,200705
Space for culture and recreation has been crowded out in modern Ireland.,502,53320,200705
We believe that it is time to redress the balance.,502,53320,200705
"Art, music, literature and drama are regularly dismissed as being the preserve of the elite.",503,53320,200705
Labour wants to challenge that perception.,503,53320,200705
"We believe that everyone, regardless of their background, should have the opportunity to engage with the arts.",503,53320,200705
"Thus we are proposing a comprehensive and properly resourced cultural strategy,",503,53320,200705
which will promote artistic excellence as well as ensuring greater access to arts and culture for all our people.,503,53320,200705
A key aim of our strategy is to improve the quality of and opportunities for education in the arts,503,53320,200705
so that all children and young people can maximise their creative potential.,706,53320,200705
Create a designated Arts section within the Department of Education which will ensure good practice in teaching of the arts at both primary and secondary level.,503,53320,200705

We see sport as an essential part of building a better Ireland for hardworking families and communities.,502,53320,200705
"As with our arts policy, we believe that the key to promoting a healthier and fitter society is to start at a young age.",502,53320,200705
Thus one of our key commitments will be to enhance the role and profile of physical education in our schools.,502,53320,200705
"Make PE an exam subject for the Junior and Leaving Certificates, giving it points status for third level entry in the latter.",506,53320,200705

Introduce after-school and holiday sports schemes for students.,502,53320,200705
Support and develop minority sports and recreational activities to ensure that all aspects and interests of our population are addressed.,502,53320,200705
Our heritage and our natural environment are precious assets.,501,53320,200705
Ireland’s historical heritage is integral to our national identity and crucial to tourism and recreation;,502,53320,200705
our economy is dependent on the natural environment.,501,53320,200705
Both must be preserved and protected.,501,53320,200705
"Heritage and environmental conservation have been cast by the present government as inhibitors of progress, economic growth and development.",305,53320,200705
This is a short-sighted and simplistic view and an inappropriate basis for the conduct of environment and conservation policy.,501,53320,200705
"We will strengthen the legal protection afforded to the cultural heritage of the people, including its archaeological, architectural, monumental, industrial, artistic and scientific heritage.",502,53320,200705

and our shared heritage.,502,53320,200705
"The duty of care for heritage and conservation out of the Ministry of the Environment, Heritage and Local government, will be transferred to our proposed Department of Climate Change, Energy and the Environment.",502,53320,200705
Responsibility for conservation of the environment and heritage should not co-exist with responsibility for infrastructure.,303,53320,200705
The Labour Party is opposed to the building of a motorway through the Tara-Skryne valley.,502,53320,200705
We accept that the M3 is necessary to relieve commuter congestion and that it should be built in three sections.,502,53320,200705
"However, the section through the Tara-Skryne valley should be re-routed to avoid the destruction of our Celtic heritage.",502,53320,200705
"■ We are particularly concerned at the possibility of major development being attracted to the area around the motorway, which would contribute further damage to Tara and its environs.",502,53320,200705

and heritage education in our schools.,502,53320,200705
Public service broadcasting is a vital public service and resource that is essential in any working democracy.,502,53320,200705
"However, Irish public service broadcasting is in danger of being rendered obsolete by the ‘digital age’.",502,53320,200705
All EU member states are to have completed the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting by 2012.,411,53320,200705
"However, under the outgoing government Ireland has made very little progress towards this target.",502,53320,200705
The next government will have to face the significant challenge of keeping public service broadcasting technologically and practically relevant in the digital age.,502,53320,200705
"If not, we are in danger of creating a ‘digital divide’ between those who can access new technologies and systems, and those who cannot.",502,53320,200705
Ensure a comprehensive digital broadcasting changeover strategy – including choice of platform(s) – is developed as a matter of urgency.,411,53320,200705

Create a new framework for the allocation and management of all radiospectrum (whether for broadcasting or other purposes).,502,53320,200705
"This would distinguish between Reserved spectrum (set aside to meet public interest, social and cultural objectives of government, including public broadcasting goals) and Commercial spectrum.",502,53320,200705
"The latter would be rights-based, assigned or allocated through market mechanisms with spectrum going to its highest value use.",502,53320,200705

Insist that RTÉ programmes are broadcast in the UK.,502,53320,200705
There must be a dramatic and fundamental change in the State’s approach to the preservation and revival of the Irish language.,502,53320,200705
"Considerable resources continue to be invested in the teaching of Irish,",502,53320,200705
yet the use of Irish has been declining since the foundation of the State.,502,53320,200705
"Despite this clear failure of policy there is no clear, strategic plan for the future of the language.",502,53320,200705
"Furthermore, there is little meaningful dialogue between the State and the citizen on key unresolved issues,",502,53320,200705
including possibility of widespread bi-lingualism.,502,53320,200705
"Debate on these issues is urgently needed, but it must be open, generous and tolerant.",502,53320,200705
We need to make a choice about the role of the Irish language in Irish society.,502,53320,200705

"but interest in its use is growing elsewhere, as demonstrated by the expansion of Irish-medium schools.",502,53320,200705
The vocabulary and idiom of the language have been adapted to the demands of contemporary society and culture.,502,53320,200705
"Irish language broadcasting has proven a great success, notably TG4 established by a Labour Minister, Michael D. Higgins.",502,53320,200705
Our objective in government is to stimulate a broad debate about the future of Irish as a spoken language,502,53320,200705
and to use this as a foundation for future policy.,502,53320,200705
It will be our aim to reform the approach of the State to Irish so that the efforts of communities and voluntary organisations are re-enforced by adequate funding and encouraged to flourish by a positive support.,502,53320,200705
Our aim will be to raise the status of Irish as a vernacular and to re-enforce its role in cultural and academic life.,502,53320,200705

We will seek as early as possible a report from each Public Body named in the Schedule to the Official Languages Act 2003,502,53320,200705
"and require it to outline its programme on the Irish Language, its success in achieving policy objectives and details of the resources committed to achieving them.",502,53320,200705
Actively support those parents wishing to have their children educated through Irish.,603,53320,200705

Examine how Irish language literacy can be improved in Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna.,502,53320,200705
We will introduce a range of measures to improve the teaching of Irish in English medium schools.,506,53320,200705

Fund the collection and publication of folklore and song as part of our heritage project.,502,53320,200705
Ireland stands at the cusp of a remarkable moment in its history.,101,53320,200705
The coming together of both communities to govern a peaceful Northern Ireland is the culmination of a long and painful journey.,101,53320,200705
Citizens on both parts of this island shared an important part of that journey when they voted overwhelmingly to support the Good Friday Agreement.,101,53320,200705
"Theirs was the strongest mandate for a new departure in Irish politics, north and south of the border.",101,53320,200705
To appreciate how far we have come we should take stock of what we are leaving behind.,101,53320,200705
"More than 3,500 deaths on this island over the last 30 years were directly linked to the sectarian conflict in the North.",101,53320,200705
"Around 100 people a year on this small island were murdered every year since 1969, simply because of who they were, where they came from, who they voted for or what church they prayed in.",101,53320,200705
"And for every murder victim there were was an ever-increasing circle of the injured, the bereaved and the frightened.",101,53320,200705
"Politicians calcified the bitterness, handing it on to their successors.",101,53320,200705
Communities were brutally segregated.,101,53320,200705
The politics of the last atrocity overshadowed the wider tragedy.,101,53320,200705
"The ‘national question’ dominated Irish life for decades when we could have been questioning what kind of social and economic future we wanted for ourselves and our children, whether those children lived in Dublin or Derry.",101,53320,200705
But that is the past.,101,53320,200705
"Today we have an opportunity to ask what kind of Ireland we want for all of its inhabitants, and the opportunity to create it.",101,53320,200705
There is a new dispensation on the island of Ireland.,101,53320,200705
We have the chance to make anew the relationship between the people of North and South and between previously divided communities in Northern Ireland.,101,53320,200705
Labour in government will continue working for peace.,106,53320,200705
"We are ambitious for a peace that is not simply the absence of aggression, but which results from a willing and easy sharing of space, a peace between people at ease with each other and working to assist each other.",106,53320,200705
"However, despite all the signs of hope at political level, the scourge of sectarianism remains.",606,53320,200705
"While the long-awaited high-level engagement between political leaders is welcome, society in Northern Ireland is now more sustained in its divisions, such as where people live, where they socialise and where they send their children to school, than it was three decades ago.",606,53320,200705
"Ironically, while the argument is often made that politicians in the North were out of step with the lives and relationships of ordinary people, the risk now is that politicians have shown an ability to share a communal life that has become entirely foreign to most of their constituents.",606,53320,200705
Labour fully supports the “Shared Future” initiative.,101,53320,200705
All of us on this island need to invest in policies and frameworks that will deliver good relations and a shared future in Northern Ireland.,101,53320,200705
"We will put reconciliation and measures to improve relationships between the communities in Northern Ireland,",101,53320,200705
"and between the people North and South, at the top of our agenda in government.",101,53320,200705
"Following the re-establishment of the Assembly and Executive, Labour wants to see swift implementation of all outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement",101,53320,200705
"– an agreement that we continue to support wholeheartedly as the best way of achieving a fully peaceful, democratic and lawful Northern Ireland and island of Ireland.",101,53320,200705
All parties with a democratic mandate must signal their support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.,101,53320,200705
"They must take their seats on the Policing Board and the District Policing Partnerships,",101,53320,200705
and demonstrate proactive participation in the policing and criminal justice structures in the North.,101,53320,200705
The PSNI must be given all the support and resources necessary to tackle dissident republican and loyalist paramilitary organisations that continue to be involved in criminality.,101,53320,200705
"Labour in government will work to further develop North/South political, economic, cultural and social links.",101,53320,200705
"This must,in the first instance,be achieved through the immediate establishment of the North/South Parliamentary Forum, to allow better relationships and understanding develop between political representatives North and South.",101,53320,200705
"We will support all efforts to develop the Northern Ireland economy, improve cross border trade, implement an all-island spatial plan and further progress the North/South agenda as laid out in the National Development Plan.",101,53320,200705
"We welcome the major progress that has been made in implementing the Patten Report, ensuring a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland.",101,53320,200705
"We will ensure increased structural co-operation and new relationships at every level, including the level of joint training, between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI.",101,53320,200705
And we will prioritise the policing secondment and lateral entry provisions of the Patten Report to allow exchanges – either on a temporary or permanent basis – between members of each police service.,101,53320,200705
"In the South, we have our own memories, some of them quite bitter.",606,53320,200705
And we have our own task of reconciliation.,606,53320,200705
"This State was founded after a spontaneous insurrection, then a war of independence and, almost immediately after that, a civil war.",606,53320,200705
The civil war cost more lives than had died in the war of independence – all of them Irish.,606,53320,200705
"It also cost more lives – around 4,000 in just eleven months – than died during 30 years of troubles in Northern Ireland.",606,53320,200705
Both sides carried out brutal acts.,606,53320,200705
"Senior figures, now prominent as icons of our political parties, died at the hands of the other side.",606,53320,200705
And it left Irish society deeply divided for generations.,606,53320,200705
Its influence in politics is still evident today.,606,53320,200705
It is time for us to recollect and to reconcile.,601,53320,200705
"We will put in train preparations for the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, in a manner that honours the contribution of the men and women of Easter Week,",601,53320,200705
while also showing respect for all traditions on the island.,607,53320,200705
Labour wil ensure that Connolly’s socialist outlook and the place of Labour in Irish history are fully represented in these preparations.,601,53320,200705
As part of the preparations for the centenary we will commission the preparation of a definitive list of all those who died in the conflict on our island in the period from Easter 1916 to the end of the civil war.,601,53320,200705
The list will be inclusive.,606,53320,200705
"It will include northerners and southerners, British and Irish, combatants and non-combatants, and it will include a description of the circumstances of each of their deaths.",606,53320,200705
"Labour, since its foundation, has been an international party.",107,53320,200705
"Its founders believed in the interdependency of the different peoples of the world,",107,53320,200705
the indivisible nature of the task of justice and the mobilising power of solidarity.,107,53320,200705
"Globalisation has greatly benefited Ireland, but with it has come ever greater responsibility.",107,53320,200705
"The free market economy,",107,53320,200705
"the diffusion of arms and military capability, climate change and the global reach of new technologies mean that we now have an unprecedented capacity to help or to harm those far beyond our national borders.",107,53320,200705
"Labour’s core ideals of freedom, equality, community and democracy have always informed our solidarity with all people in all nations,",201,53320,200705
and particularly those in the developing world who are most in need of our support.,107,53320,200705
"In 2007, that support is needed more than ever.",107,53320,200705
"The UN’s Millennium Development Goals are still some way from realisation, with only five countries reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overseas aid.",107,53320,200705
It is essential that developing countries are also able to trade their own way out of poverty.,107,53320,200705
"The WTO’s Doha Development Round, which was supposed to have concluded by 2004, collapsed in 2006.",107,53320,200705
"Meanwhile, in the absence of the development-friendly trade agreements it was intended to produce, bilateral trade treaties have proliferated.",107,53320,200705
"These bilateral treaties offer little of the protection afforded by the negotiating blocs of the WTO, leaving the least developed countries open to exploitation.",107,53320,200705
"A globalised economy also means a globalised arms trade, and one that is rapidly expanding.",105,53320,200705
"Arms components come from all over the world, including Ireland, while the movement of production facilities, technology and brokers is more fluid than ever before.",105,53320,200705
Ireland’s public support for an Arms Trade Treaty and a ban on cluster bombs is a welcome step in the right direction.,105,53320,200705
"However, is it essential that the forthcoming Control of Exports Bill,",105,53320,200705
"intended to update our legislation on arms trading and brokering,",105,53320,200705
"precipitates greater transparency in Ireland’s export and brokering of military, security and police apparatus and small arms.",105,53320,200705
International security must be achieved through adherence to international law.,107,53320,200705
"We are fully committed to the United Nations and reform / which would make it a more effective, more democratic institution.",107,53320,200705
Ireland must respect international law within its own borders and proactively support it abroad.,107,53320,200705
Our defence forces should be developed to respond to new peacekeeping challenges and natural disasters,106,53320,200705
and to build on their proud history in UN and EU peacekeeping missions.,108,53320,200705
"In an increasingly interconnected world, Ireland has a real choice to make about its interaction with the global community.",107,53320,200705
We believe that that choice must be an ethical one.,107,53320,200705
Pass our Development Cooperation Bill to establish Ireland’s official development aid / expenditure as 0.7 per cent of GNP annually.,107,53320,200705
The equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP will be paid in quarterly installments into our proposed Development Cooperation Ireland Fund regardless of whether funds from the previous year have been spent or not.,107,53320,200705

We also support the creation of an international Climate Change Fund to help vulnerable developing countries adapt to changing weather patterns arising from global warming.,416,53320,200705

The Irish people prize their tradition of military neutrality and we intend to uphold our Labour tradition of positive neutrality.,105,53320,200705

"It needs to use this power for development, to eradicate hunger, control the arms trade and foster democracy and human rights.",107,53320,200705
In the WTO we need to ensure greater openness and a fairer world trade system particularly for the developing world.,406,53320,200705

We particularly believe that the NEAP process needs to be re-examined in this light.,108,53320,200705
This Party has achieved significant progress in reducing tax.,402,53420,200705
The top rate has been reduced from 48% to 41%.,402,53420,200705
"Our commitment, should we be re-elected, is to further cut the top rate by another 1% in Budget 2008.",402,53420,200705
"There have been substantial reductions in the basic rate of income tax too, down from 26% to 20%.",402,53420,200705
The net effect is that the income tax system has been made considerably more progressive under this government:,402,53420,200705
"In 1997, a single person on the average industrial wage paid 22% of their income in income tax.",402,53420,200705
In 2007 such a person will pay just 9%.,402,53420,200705
"In 1997, the top 1% of income earners contributed 14% of the total income tax take.",503,53420,200705
Now they contribute over 20%.,408,53420,200705
"As a result, unemployment has tumbled from “old Europe” levels of over 10% with emigration under the opposition parties to less than 5%/ with considerable immigration today.",408,53420,200705
There is a consensus amongst economic commentators that apart from a major external or internal shock the Irish economy should continue to grow strongly in a range from just under 5% to 5.7%.,410,53420,200705
This will generate a considerable increase in the resources available to the Exchequer.,410,53420,200705
The question is whether all of these resources should be spent further growing public expenditure?,401,53420,200705
The Progressive Democrats believe in returning a significant portion of the increased resources to the people by way of tax cuts.,402,53420,200705
The Progressive Democrats believe that tax reduction should be a strategic objective for the next government.,402,53420,200705
We believe that it will be possible to significantly reduce the tax bill of middle-income earners,402,53420,200705
while allowing for generous growth in public spending.,402,53420,200705
"Subject to maintaining budgetary prudence, in government the Progressive Democrats will:",414,53420,200705
"Adjust tax bands so that a couple, both earning, can earn at least €100,000 and only pay income tax at the standard rate.",402,53420,200705
"This would mean that a single worker could earn €50,000 and only pay income tax at the standard rate.",402,53420,200705
"Increase tax credits so that couples earning up to €40,000 will pay no income tax.",402,53420,200705
"This would mean that a single worker could earn €20,000 and pay no income tax.",402,53420,200705
Reduce the higher rate of income tax to 38% in the lifetime of the next government.,402,53420,200705
Reduce the lower rate of income tax to 18% in the lifetime of the next government.,402,53420,200705
"Ensure no new, additional taxes / levies on employment.",402,53420,200705
Guarantee that those earning the minimum wage pay no income tax.,503,53420,200705
Continue to increase tax credits and bands so that inflation is not used as a tax-raising mechanism.,402,53420,200705
Property prices have risen dramatically over the last decade,0,53420,200705
and this has fuelled a massive rise in receipts of Stamp Duty.,0,53420,200705
Stamp Duty receipts have jumped from €0.5 billion in 1997 to €3.6 billion in 2006.,0,53420,200705
Stamp Duty operates in a way that is arbitrary and often unfair.,0,53420,200705
"A couple who each own an apartment worth €300,000 would have to pay €45,000 in Stamp Duty if they were to simply buy and move together into a second-hand €600,000 house.",0,53420,200705
"In other words, the couple would have to pay about one-and-a-half times the average wage just to move in together and without increasing their net investment in property.",0,53420,200705
"A first-time buyer couple might decide to purchase a second-hand house which is on the market for €630,000.",0,53420,200705
"They expect to pay Stamp Duty at 6% totalling almost €38,000.",0,53420,200705
"But if the house price goes above €635,000 they have to pay Stamp Duty at a rate of 9%.",0,53420,200705
"If the house price rose to €640,000, the couple would have to pay almost €58,000.",0,53420,200705
"In other words, a rise in the house price of just €10,000 could trigger an increase in Stamp Duty of €20,000.",0,53420,200705
"A couple whose children have left the family home might decide to sell their home in order to move into a smaller second-hand house costing €450,000.",0,53420,200705
"They would have to pay almost €34,000 in Stamp Duty.",0,53420,200705
"Michael McDowell raised the issue of Stamp Duty at a meeting of the Progressive Democrats on September 18th, 2006.",305,53420,200705
Stamp duty is an issue of huge concern for thousands of home owners and would-be home owners around the country.,0,53420,200705
It is our belief that there is scope for a significant re-adjustment of the stamp duty situation as it pertains to homeowners.,0,53420,200705
"We intend in our election manifesto, which will be published next year, to address this issue head on.",0,53420,200705
The Progressive Democrats believe in speedily reducing the burden of Stamp Duty on owner-occupiers,402,53420,200705
and in reducing the unfairness of the current system caused by the lack of tapering relief.,0,53420,200705
We do not see any need to reduce Stamp Duty for professional investors.,503,53420,200705
"Subject to maintaining budgetary prudence, in government the Progressive Democrats will:",414,53420,200705
Abolish stamp duty for first time buyers,402,53420,200705
Make stamp duty fairer by “banding” rates so that owner-occupiers pay the higher rate only on the portion of the price over each threshold,408,53420,200705
Given the critical nature of this particular reform we will:,408,53420,200705
Implement our reform with an immediate effect.,408,53420,200705
Implement our reform via legislation enacted before the new Dáil rises for the 2007 Summer Recess.,408,53420,200705
"Reducing stamp duty to be paid on the average national house price by €8,250 - from €15,500 to €7,250,",402,53420,200705
"and reducing stamp duty charge to be paid on the average home in Dublin by €17,050 - from €32,250 to €15,200",402,53420,200705
The terms that currently apply regarding stamp duty exemption will also apply to the Party's new proposal to abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers.,0,53420,200705
A first time buyer is a person who has not previously purchased or built a house or apartment anywhere in the world and who is purchasing a house or apartment for use as their principal place of residence.,0,53420,200705
"Where there is more than one buyer, each of the buyers must be a first time buyer to qualify for first  time buyer provisions.",0,53420,200705
"The exemption applies only where the size of the property does not exceed 125 square metres / 1,345 square feet.",0,53420,200705
The ‘banding’ proposal applies only to principal place of residence.,0,53420,200705
The Progressive Democrats in Government have devised and implemented policies to deliver increasing prosperity to our population,414,53420,200705
via economic growth.,414,53420,200705
Another product of our economic success is the 17% increase in the population of our country over the past ten years - now 4.2 million people.,414,53420,200705
By 2021 our population may well exceed 5 million people.,411,53420,200705
This population growth places incredible demands on our transport infrastructure,411,53420,200705
and Ireland is moving from a low base towards world-class transport infrastructure provision.,411,53420,200705
Significant strides have been made over the last decade in the area of infrastructural development.,411,53420,200705

and a serious deficit in physical and social infrastructure in many areas.,305,53420,200705
"In government, the Progressive Democrats will:",303,53420,200705
"Create a National Planning Monitoring and Enforcement Office in the relevant Department, to police the planning system.",605,53420,200705

"to seek legal redress against developers and, where appropriate,",605,53420,200705
individuals responsible for breaches of the planning law by development companies.,605,53420,200705

"Information from this database will be available to all relevant Government Departments and should (using predictive modelling) form the basis of planning the roll-out of public services such as education and health,",504,53420,200705
where possible,303,53420,200705
Propose a more accurate definition of a ‘local person’ in planning guidelines and development plans to mean either a person born and reared in a rural area;,303,53420,200705

ASBOs – Anti-social behaviour orders have been introduced this year.,606,53420,200705
Senior Gardaí can apply to the District Court for an “order” which would prohibit a person from behaving in an anti-social manner.,605,53420,200705
Similar to civil injunctions (breaches of which are punishable as a criminal contempt) a breach of an ASBO will be a criminal offence.,605,53420,200705

These may include a condition that he or she keeps the Gardaí informed of his or her movements.,605,53420,200705

"The headline crime rate in 1983 was 29.3 per 1,000 population.",305,53420,200705
In 2006 the figure had fallen to 26 even though recording of crime had probably increased due to the introduction of the Garda Pulse system and the fact that more items are insured.,305,53420,200705
"But regardless of whether crime is a greater problem or a lesser problem than in the past, it remains a serious problem which we are committed to combating.",605,53420,200705
And there is no doubt that gangland crime and drug crime are running at very serious levels.,605,53420,200705
"For that reason, the Gardaí were asked to set up Operation Anvil.",605,53420,200705

Much of the remaining poverty in today’s Ireland is concentrated amongst particular groups of people and in particular geographical areas.,504,53420,200705
We are strongly committed to eliminating this remaining poverty from our society.,504,53420,200705
"This requires a much more targeted approach tailored to meet the specific needs of these groups,",504,53420,200705
as well as maintaining a dynamic economy with full employment to facilitate their full inclusion in society.,410,53420,200705
In our overall fiscal framework we have provided for the resources necessary to fund an ambitious targeted programme of poverty reduction.,504,53420,200705
As a result in Government the Progressive Democrats will pursue the overall objective of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16:,504,53420,200705

Local people and neighbours will become the outside link with the world for older people who might otherwise be isolated geographically or socially.,504,53420,200705

Provide people on lower and middle incomes with increased incentive to provide for later life.,402,53420,200705
We will introduce a Special Pension Incentive Account (SPIA) where the State will contribute €1 for every €2 contributed by the individual.,402,53420,200705
"This will be available to all individuals earning up to twice average industrial earnings (currently €66,400), regardless of their tax liability.",402,53420,200705

The agenda for the Progressive Democrats in the next government will be to lead Ireland towards excellence in all aspects of healthcare in our country.,504,53420,200705
"This will mean transforming patients’ experience of health services, so that they will know that they,",504,53420,200705
"and they alone, are put first.",504,53420,200705
We believe there is no impossible barrier to Ireland achieving excellence in health.,504,53420,200705
We are doing it on the economy;,305,53420,200705
we can do it on health.,305,53420,200705

"Implementing these guarantees will require constant focus and excellent procedures,",303,53420,200705
where progress is measured and managed to achieve the results.,303,53420,200705
They will also require change in the way things are done throughout health,303,53420,200705
and cannot be achieved without the reformed working arrangements we envisage.,303,53420,200705
"Management, clinicians and health professionals all have a part to play.",301,53420,200705
Well-managed budgets are also required.,414,53420,200705
We believe these service guarantees will be achieved and sustained where there is overall budget discipline,414,53420,200705
"and a drive for efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.",303,53420,200705

"For at least the last 13 years, the system of support for people needing nursing home care was unfair, unpredictable and, in many cases, financially devastating.",706,53420,200705
"No government addressed this huge problem, until Minister Mary Harney brought to Government the Fair Deal that was adopted as policy,",305,53420,200705
"meaning entirely new, fair, transparent rules for sharing of the cost of nursing home care.",303,53420,200705
"This will mean everyone will make some contribution to the cost of care, on a fair basis,",503,53420,200705

Patients and their families will not be exposed to rising nursing home prices.,504,53420,200705
People will be supported equally in public and private nursing home places.,504,53420,200705
"Overall, the State will continue to meet more than two-thirds of the cost of long term care in our country.",504,53420,200705
"In the context of the Fair Deal, we will also invest in new public long term care places.",504,53420,200705
"Minister Harney has already provided funding for 800 new beds in 2007, over 400 of which will be in the public sector.",504,53420,200705
A further 400 public long term care beds will be put in place in 2008.,504,53420,200705
"We will finalise the national review of long term care bed needs, in the context of the target that no more than 41/2 per cent of people over-65 should need residential care places.",504,53420,200705
Our strategic goal for hospitals in the next term of government is to set and enforce explicit standards for the first time.,504,53420,200705
We will bring forward and implement recommendations of the Commission on Patient  Safety recently established by Minister Mary Harney.,303,53420,200705
This will deal with all aspects of system design and procedures that affect patient safety.,303,53420,200705
One of its key tasks is to make recommendations on a system of licensing of hospitals.,303,53420,200705
We will introduce legislation for a mandatory licensing system for all hospitals in the country.,303,53420,200705
"Patients in all hospitals, public, private and voluntary, will increasingly be guaranteed transparent standards of care,",303,53420,200705
and those standards will be enforced by the new Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) which Minister Mary Harney has now brought on to a statutory level.,303,53420,200705
The legislation will have a robust inspection and reporting regime.,303,53420,200705
"Ultimately, the Authority will have the power to withdraw a license from a hospital,",303,53420,200705
as well as from other health care settings such as clinics.,303,53420,200705
This will be a very challenging regime for hospitals,303,53420,200705
and will strengthen assurances to the public that standards are set and enforced in all health care settings.,303,53420,200705
Our pursuit of explicit and transparent standards will mean we will press for ever cleaner hospitals until all reach a standard of excellence that is continuously raised higher.,303,53420,200705
We will continue with the national hospitals hygiene audits that were commenced as a result of Minister Mary Harney’s actions on A&E.,303,53420,200705
"Ireland has already a low rate of Healthcare Acquired Infections by European standards, but a relatively high rate of MRSA infection.",303,53420,200705
"Reducing MRSA infections will require many actions, including reducing the rate of antibiotic use.",303,53420,200705
This is one of the main reasons for Ireland’s high MRSA rate.,504,53420,200705
"We will relentlessly pursue actions to achieve reductions in MRSA infections,",303,53420,200705
"first, with a 30% target reduction, and then moving on to put Ireland in the top half of European countries for MRSA control.",303,53420,200705
"We will ensure that HIQA sets and enforces a clear standard on Healthcare Associated Infections,",303,53420,200705
and that the new system of licensing will put a strong emphasis on all infection control.,303,53420,200705
"Ultimately, hospitals will risk losing their license if they fail to control infections to a specified minimum standard.",605,53420,200705
"Because mistake do happen, we will introduce a streamlined patient compensation scheme to ensure that patients can receive compensation for medical and healthcare errors",303,53420,200705
without lengthy legal processes involving the establishment of liability in law.,303,53420,200705
We will use the successful model of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to ensure patients get speedy and fair compensation.,303,53420,200705
"We will also seek to remove a blame culture in relation to medical mishaps,",303,53420,200705
so that there can be real learning from mistakes.,303,53420,200705
"In this context, we will seek to alleviate as much as possible the burden of impending litigation from doctors and health care professionals.",303,53420,200705
"We will work with the HSE to measure, manage and reduce the time it takes to admit patients to hospitals (whether through A&E or planned admissions);",504,53420,200705
"and, we will also measure, manage and reduce the time it takes to discharge patients.",504,53420,200705
"We will invest in new and more sophisticated medical technologies,",504,53420,200705
"in upskilling our doctors and other professionals,",504,53420,200705
and in developing new purpose built facilities to further increase day care treatments each year.,504,53420,200705
"We have greatly strengthened the diagnostic capabilities of our acute hospitals in the past decade,",504,53420,200705
"and we will continue to invest in better, speedier and more effective diagnostic technologies through the health capital programme.",504,53420,200705
"We will develop community diagnostic centres allowing primary care teams and GPs easier and faster access for their patients,",303,53420,200705
and enabling hospital diagnostic services to concentrate on more acute cases.,504,53420,200705
"We will implement the new consultants’ contract that will provide for teamwork and management among consultants,",704,53420,200705
in turn helping to raise the standards of patient safety and quality care.,303,53420,200705
"The new contract will enable us to add 1,500 new consultants in a planned expansion of services.",0,53420,200705
"The new consultants’ contract will mean patients are seen by a senior doctor faster, are admitted to hospital faster and are discharged faster.",303,53420,200705
Patients will be discharged every day of the week from hospitals.,303,53420,200705
"We will ensure much faster access for public patients to hospital services,",504,53420,200705
using a combination of investment in public hospitals;,504,53420,200705
"closer management of private work in public hospitals,",504,53420,200705
"and purchasing services for public patients, where necessary, from private sector providers.",504,53420,200705
We believe there is no need to introduce a compulsory insurance system to achieve this goal of equity of access.,503,53420,200705
"We will implement new services and new investments without further reviews or bureaucratic delays using, where appropriate, the private sector and philanthropic initiatives to best effect including in",504,53420,200705
The new national tertiary Children’s Hospital,504,53420,200705
The new Central Mental Hospital,504,53420,200705
A new acute hospital in the North East,504,53420,200705
A new Rehabilitation Hospital,504,53420,200705
"The new Cancer Control Strategy,",504,53420,200705
including the National Radiotherapy Network.,504,53420,200705
We will continue to invest substantially in public hospitals according to the capital funding set out in the National Development Plan,504,53420,200705
– over €2 billion will be spent between now and 2013 on acute services.,504,53420,200705
"We will support the building of new hospital facilities to free up about 1,000 public beds through the co-location initiative.",401,53420,200705
"This is far and away the most cost effective and fastest way of providing 1,000 extra beds.",504,53420,200705
Over 400 public more will be added through the public capital programme.,504,53420,200705
"With these, and the 1,200 new beds since 2001, we will be very far advanced towards the Health Strategy goal of 3,000 new beds by 2011.",504,53420,200705
This government has already increased public acute hospital beds at the fastest rate in modern times,504,53420,200705
"– about 170 per year more, compared to 30 per year under the previous government.",504,53420,200705
We will carry out a further review to analyse acute hospital bed needs up to 2020.,504,53420,200705
We will also focus public capital investment on refurbishment and creating more single occupancy rooms.,504,53420,200705
"We will seek to get the best use out of beds, with more use of day case procedures",504,53420,200705
and reducing the length of time patients stay in hospital at least to European averages (for the age structure of the population),504,53420,200705
"We will guarantee that all patients will have access to all publicly-funded beds in every public hospital, starting at co-location campuses.",504,53420,200705
This will end the situation for many years where about 20 per cent of beds are reserved for private patients.,504,53420,200705
We will strongly support the new co-located facilities at public hospitals to maximise the potential for shared services between public and private hospitals to benefit all patients,504,53420,200705
"We will systematically purchase services for public patients from private sector providers,",504,53420,200705
"expanding the National Treatment Purchase Fund,",504,53420,200705
where value for money and faster services are achieved,504,53420,200705
We will re-organise the payments system for treatments provided by hospitals so as to ensure funding rewards productivity for patients.,504,53420,200705
"It will be focused on moving to a procedure basis for payments to hospitals as much as possible,",410,53420,200705
"within a budget provided by taxpayers,",403,53420,200705
so that the public system can pay in the one way for treatments in both public and private hospitals.,403,53420,200705
"We do not need a new, compulsory insurance tax to change the payments system.",504,53420,200705
This will help bring better incentives and productivity to hospitals.,504,53420,200705
"We will not, however, introduce tax-funded fee per item payments solely to consultants in public hospitals,",414,53420,200705
while all other staff are paid on a salary basis.,414,53420,200705
"We will provide as wide a range of services in local hospitals as possible, where patient safety and quality can be assured.",504,53420,200705
We will create hospital networks where local hospitals are linked with larger regional hospitals for integrated and higher standards of clinical care for patients.,504,53420,200705
"Where appropriate, and it makes sense for patients, we will encourage the development of primary care services on or adjacent to hospital sites.",504,53420,200705
"Where hospital services are re-organised,",504,53420,200705
"we will require that the HSE does so in a manner that commands the confidence of patients and of the public,",504,53420,200705
so that no service is changed without a demonstrably better one being put in its place.,504,53420,200705
The public interest has to be the over-riding concern in the way all medical and health care professionals are regulated.,403,53420,200705
"We will continue the overhaul we have started to the range of legislation that governs the regulation of health professionals, including doctors, pharmacists, health and social care professionals and nurses.",403,53420,200705
"We will create a modern, open regulatory regime that is responsive to patients’ needs and is also supportive of continuing professional development and competence assurance.",403,53420,200705
"Since the public interest and open accountability must come first, no professional regulatory body will be controlled by members of that profession themselves.",403,53420,200705
We will implement and support the new Medical Council to regulate medical professionals in the public interest.,403,53420,200705
Minister Mary Harney has brought forward the first overhaul of medical regulation law in nearly 30 years.,403,53420,200705
"With a lay majority on the Council and on the Fitness to Practice Committee, we will ensure that medical regulation is carried out transparently and with modern accountability.",303,53420,200705
We will support the work of the Medical Council in the area of continuing competence assurance.,303,53420,200705
Minister Harney introduced regulatory arrangements for twelve health care professions for the first time which includes a Health and Social Care Professionals’ Council with a lay majority.,403,53420,200705
We will ensure that the Registration Boards to support the newly established Council are operable before the end of 2007.,403,53420,200705
"She has also put the regulation of pharmacy on a new, modernised footing through the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.",403,53420,200705
We will continue to bring forward modernised legislation to regulate the business of pharmacy services in the public interest.,403,53420,200705
"During the lifetime of the next government, we will also modernise the legislation relating to the regulation of dental services through the Dental Council,",403,53420,200705
and nurses and midwives through An Bord Altranais.,403,53420,200705
"With the reformed health structures in place, the challenge is now to get best value for taxpayers’ money in a system of health funding that is sustainable.",303,53420,200705
"The easy political choice is to offer more of the same, and more of the same for free.",305,53420,200705
"We believe the more sustainable and financially sound approach is to use taxpayers’ money to support people who need support,",505,53420,200705
"rather than offering free benefits to people who are already well off and can afford,",505,53420,200705
"for example, health insurance or visits to the GP.",505,53420,200705
It is no answer simply to make more promises and continue spending more until health spending reaches 15 or 20 per cent of national income.,414,53420,200705
"Anyone, anywhere in the world, who has looked seriously at health spending recognises this.",0,53420,200705
"We envisage that, with the correct policies, our economy can grow by an average of 5 per cent per annum for the next five years.",410,53420,200705
"That will mean we can, and we will, bring public health current spending to approximately €21 billion by the end of a five year term of government, up from €14 billion now.",504,53420,200705
We are committed to a level of public investment in health capital projects that has already put Ireland highest in the OECD (alongside Norway) in terms of public capital investment as a proportion of national income (0.6 per cent of GNP).,504,53420,200705
Few other governments in the world can make these commitments.,305,53420,200705
"As a party we are committed to these high,",305,53420,200705
"and sustainable, levels of public investment in health.",504,53420,200705
We will also actively encourage the private sector to play an integrated role in the provision of health services in Ireland.,401,53420,200705
We wish to see innovation in the interplay between public and private sectors.,401,53420,200705
This is now the European trend.,0,53420,200705
"And it has been the tradition for all our modern history, in hospitals, and especially in front line community services.",0,53420,200705
Other parties would now freeze out the private sector.,305,53420,200705
It is against European developments to cut off a role in public health policy for the private sector.,401,53420,200705
We believe patients want quality-assured care.,0,53420,200705
The vast majority of the Irish public do not reject the private sector in health,401,53420,200705
– they are as happy to be treated in a private hospital as a public hospital.,305,53420,200705
Public patients who have used private hospitals paid by the National Treatment Purchase Fund have expressed high levels of satisfaction.,503,53420,200705
The use of the private providers for public patients prevents a divide into a two tier health system in our country.,504,53420,200705
"As we license all hospitals, they should all be available for use by the State as service providers to patients.",401,53420,200705
The co-location hospitals projects will free up public beds in our hospitals,504,53420,200705
and will offer excellent opportunities for public and private management to work together at large public hospital sites.,505,53420,200705
- Public investment in health will continue to be the predominant form of funding.,504,53420,200705
We are committed to continuing sustainable growth in the levels of public spending and public investment in health.,504,53420,200705
We will take measures also to support a competitive health insurance market,403,53420,200705
and to continue support for community rating so that health insurance remains affordable for older and sicker people;,403,53420,200705
the cost to individuals should never be a barrier to accessing necessary health care; and contributions to any costs of care should be based on means.,505,53420,200705
"We do not believe the expansion of free services for all, irrespective of means, is the best use of scarce taxpayers’ resources.",505,53420,200705
We do not believe compulsory health insurance is necessary in addition to compulsory taxation to fund our health services.,402,53420,200705
We believe that hospitals and service-providers will ultimately be paid on results and outcomes achieved,408,53420,200705
The HSE will be required to set and achieve value for money targets and management held accountable for these,303,53420,200705
The best use for public health services will be made of land assets held by the HSE.,303,53420,200705
"We believe that people want more and better health services to be delivered outside hospitals, that is, in community settings.",301,53420,200705
The community based health services are the ones that most people encounter.,301,53420,200705
"We will work to ensure that entitlements to health benefits such as medical cards, GP visit cards, and community drugs schemes",504,53420,200705
"will be simplified, easier to obtain, and better co-ordinated with other income support payments provided by the State.",303,53420,200705
"We reiterate in this manifesto the community health and health promotion strategies and implementation plans brought forward by the Government in recent years, ranging from Mental Health,",504,53420,200705
"Primary Care, Childrens’ Health,",504,53420,200705
"Obesity,",504,53420,200705
Alcohol Abuse,504,53420,200705
and Traveller Health.,705,53420,200705
Space does not permit us to reiterate all the goals and actions of these strategies but we remain committed to their implementation.,305,53420,200705
"We will implement and fund expanded multi-disciplinary primary care teams around the country, and developing new out of hours services",504,53420,200705
We will work with the private service providers and the private sector to implement a major nationwide facilities development programme,504,53420,200705

We will bring forward a comprehensive development programme for national Palliative Care services to include new and more accessible facilities and services across the country,504,53420,200705
We will fully operate the Sexual Assault and Treatment Units pioneered under this government and further review additional centres when existing units have a track record to analyse,504,53420,200705
"We will simplify, make fairer and more understandable, the eligibility for all health and social services;",303,53420,200705
we will build on the radical changes,303,53420,200705
we have introduced to the means test for medical cards and GP visit cards in the last two years to ensure that these benefits are made available promptly to those who need them.,504,53420,200705
"In the past two years, we have increased annual funding by €50 million to begin implementation of the Mental Health strategy,",504,53420,200705
A Vision for Change which will replace the old psychiatric hospitals with modern community based services and new acute units attached to general hospitals.,504,53420,200705
We intend to complete this ambitious programme in the lifetime of the next government.,504,53420,200705
"We will focus resources, awareness and new forms of interventions and supports to help reduce the tragedy of suicide in our country",504,53420,200705

We will take actions to change the culture of binge drinking and excessive use of alcohol;,605,53420,200705
"we will continuously review the effectiveness of voluntary restrictions on alcohol advertising,",605,53420,200705
and require more ambitious actions by the industry where there is evidence of their effectiveness.,605,53420,200705
"We will work with other Government departments,",605,53420,200705
"with communities and with young people to combat the scourge of drugs, alcohol and other substance misuse that afflicts our society",303,53420,200705
"Recognising the unacceptably high levels of death and injury on our roads, and the consequences for individuals and families, and on our health services,",605,53420,200705
we will work with the Road Safety Authority and other government departments in education and public information programmes to heighten awareness on road safety.,506,53420,200705
We will work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland to improve services for people in our border  communities,101,53420,200705
"We will also work to bring forward agreed all-island programmes that bring practical health benefits to all people on the island,",101,53420,200705
"and we will remove, where possible, any practical barriers to all-island cooperation.",101,53420,200705
A critical step towards a change agenda that will deliver excellent patient services will be for all in health to work together as never before.,701,53420,200705
"There are 120,000 people working in public health services,",701,53420,200705

We intend to pursue that opportunity now.,0,53420,200705
The Progressive Democrats will constructively work in a new health forum that will challenge all health participants to pursue the shared goal of achieving excellence in patient services.,0,53420,200705
"We see the outcome as a Health Pact for Ireland containing specific, time deliverable actions for implementation starting in 2008.",0,53420,200705

Fundamental issues will be addressed to ensure better organisation of work practices and working times,303,53420,200705
"for best patient care – and more satisfying, productive work for health professionals– across all services, especially in hospitals.",701,53420,200705
"We also seek a working environment in health that is constantly open to change, innovation and the use of new technologies for delivering more services and better patient care.",303,53420,200705
We intend that a showcase for changed work practices and organisation,303,53420,200705
should enable faster and most efficient implementation of the new Cancer Control Strategy.,303,53420,200705
"This strategy, published by the Government in 2006, has received widespread support.",303,53420,200705

We have a big agenda for change and excellence in health.,305,53420,200705
It is a complex and challenging task.,305,53420,200705
But it is also compelling.,305,53420,200705
And that is why the Progressive Democrats seek a mandate for ambitious health reform that puts patients first.,305,53420,200705
"Ireland’s education system has done an excellent job,",506,53420,200705

Our Party constitution has set as one of our aims to ‘promote a European Union dedicated to liberal and democratic principles’.,108,53420,200705
The current government has made substantial progress advancing Ireland's interests in the European Union:,108,53420,200705
Ireland entered the European Monetary Union in 1999.,108,53420,200705
"This government achieved agreement with the EU on a single, low rate of corporation tax.",108,53420,200705
This government has protected the requirement for unanimous decisions on taxation in negotiations for the Nice Treaty and for  the draft EU Constitution.,108,53420,200705
We established the National Forum on Europe to promote open and considered debate on Europe.,108,53420,200705
"We have strongly promoted the work, begun at the Lisbon European Council in 2000,",108,53420,200705
to enable the EU to enhance its competitiveness so as to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.,411,53420,200705
We secured approval of the Nice Treaty together,108,53420,200705
with a constitutional amendment excluding the State from taking part in a Common European Defence policy.,105,53420,200705
Ireland successfully negotiated agreement of the draft European Constitution.,108,53420,200705
Winning public support for the draft Constitutional Treaty.,108,53420,200705
Promoting the Lisbon agenda.,108,53420,200705
"Promote ratification of the draft European Constitution as a fair agreement,",108,53420,200705
which balances national sovereignty with the need for the EU to operate efficiently.,108,53420,200705

Oppose those who seek to misappropriate the EU for the sake of having arguments with the USA.,108,53420,200705
Promote ‘subsidiarity’ to mean what it should mean: only those things which must be done centrally will be done centrally.,301,53420,200705
Strenuously oppose any attempt to remove the requirement of unanimity for EU decisions on taxation.,110,53420,200705
Rapid economic growth and the accession of new members to the European Union has transformed Ireland from a net emigration country to a net immigration country.,705,53420,200705
Many immigrants play key roles in our economy.,705,53420,200705
There are three separate elements that comprise the flow of immigration:,705,53420,200705
EU citizens - persons who are entitled to come here to reside or work (with the exception of citizens of Bulgaria and Romania).,705,53420,200705
Citizens of non-EU countries - persons who must apply for a residence permit (to reside) and for a work permit (if they wish to work).,705,53420,200705
"They do not have an entitlement to come here, and there are cases where persons remain here illegally without a permit or after a permit has expired.",705,53420,200705
Asylum seekers - persons not entitled to work while their application for asylum is considered.,705,53420,200705
About 90% of asylum applications are rejected.,705,53420,200705
The challenge facing us is to afford protection to genuine refugees while ensuring that our immigration laws,705,53420,200705
and procedures are respected not only in the interests of our own citizens but also in support of international efforts to combat transnational crime syndicates which exploit migrants.,705,53420,200705
The Government has made considerable progress in the area of immigration and integration:,305,53420,200705
"When the EU expanded on January 1st, 2004 to include the 10 “Accession States”,",108,53420,200705
Ireland made the generous decision to allow the citizens of these States to come and work here without work permits.,705,53420,200705
Only the UK and Sweden joined us in that decision – the other 12 member States did not.,705,53420,200705
"When Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU on January 1st, 2007, the Government decided to take a cautious approach.",110,53420,200705
Romanian and Bulgarian nationals will continue to have to apply for work permits to work in Ireland.,110,53420,200705
However they will be given preference over migrants seeking to come and work in Ireland from non-European Economic Area countries.,705,53420,200705
"On September 6th 2006, Minister Michael McDowell, TD published the general scheme of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.",0,53420,200705
No foreign national has an absolute right to come here.,0,53420,200705
The immigration system must protect security and good order in the State.,0,53420,200705
Human rights must be fully respected.,201,53420,200705
Economic and social sustainability in Ireland.,416,53420,200705
Drawing a clear distinction between those who are here legally and those who are not.,705,53420,200705
Selectivity – the Employment Permits Act sets out provisions aimed at attracting highly-skilled people in particular sectors.,705,53420,200705
It also provides that they can bring their families with them.,705,53420,200705
Provision will be made for long-term residence permits (modelled on the US Green Card system).,705,53420,200705
"Asylum seeking has been controlled by a series of measures which has cut the flow of application from 11,634 in 2002 to 4,314 in 2006, a 63% reduction:",0,53420,200705
Changes were made to our asylum legislation to introduce the “safe country of origin” concept in September 2003.,0,53420,200705
This means that asylum seekers must apply for asylum in the first safe country they arrive in (rather than use such countries as a transit point from which to travel to Ireland).,0,53420,200705
Carriers’ liability was introduced in September 2003 to deter airlines and other carriers from bringing illegal immigrants into Ireland.,705,53420,200705
Rent supplement to asylum seekers no longer provided.,0,53420,200705
"Legal sanctions against employers have been introduced to penalise the employment of illegal immigrants in the Employment Permits Act, 2003.",705,53420,200705
The citizenship referendum meant that children born to asylum seekers were no longer automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.,203,53420,200705
Genuine asylum seekers under U.N.Programmes have been increased from 40 to 200 per year.,0,53420,200705
The National Action Plan Against Racism reflects our general approach to integration policy.,607,53420,200705
"It incorporates intercultural frameworks which involve principles of inclusion,",607,53420,200705
Ireland made the generous decision to allow the citizens of these States to come and work here without work permits.,607,53420,200705
"The challenge now, of course, is to extend our horizons; to go beyond antiracism measures",607,53420,200705
as we begin to understand the totality of initiatives needed to work towards societal cohesion.,607,53420,200705
The State-run Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) has established an Integration Fund aimed at encouraging and facilitating cross-cutting projects which will have a major leverage effect in the integration area.,607,53420,200705
"These projects cover English language training,",607,53420,200705
information provision to immigrants and interpretation,607,53420,200705
and translation facilities.,607,53420,200705
"Promote integration as a two-way process, which requires give and take on both sides.",607,53420,200705
"We have little historical or constitutional basis for seeing ourselves as having a monochrome, monofilament authentic Irish identity.",607,53420,200705
"While the precise agenda for our common space needs to be debated and agreed, they must surely include essential items;",607,53420,200705
"obedience to our national laws, freedom from discrimination of any sort (including gender),",201,53420,200705
and inclusion in the democratic process.,202,53420,200705
"Use the NDP to promote immigrant integration (€36 million), language support (including 550 additional teachers -€637 million) and to continue funding the National Action Plan Against Racism €27 million).",607,53420,200705
"Pass and implement the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.",605,53420,200705
This will set out a clear and fair structure for immigration from non-EU states in the future.,605,53420,200705
The new law will make clear that those who are present illegally in the country will be deported and refused access to welfare and other Government services.,605,53420,200705
Continue to accelerate the processing of asylum applications.,0,53420,200705
A programme of major investment in IT systems will enable the State to control immigration through the visa system and through immigration ID cards with biometric details.,605,53420,200705
Consider tightening the asylum system.,0,53420,200705
"In particular, consideration is being given to a scheme which already operates in the UK and the Netherlands.",0,53420,200705
This would compel asylum seekers to remain in asylum centres while their applications are being considered.,0,53420,200705
They would not be locked into these centres but their asylum application would lapse if they abscond.,0,53420,200705
Such a system already operates in the UK and the Netherlands.,0,53420,200705
This system limits fraud (via illegal employment and multiple welfare receipts) by asylum seekers.,605,53420,200705
"Transfer the ‘equality’ function from the Department of Justice to the new Department of Social and Equality Affairs , with responsibility for integration policy.",503,53420,200705
Our Party is firmly of the view that participation in sport,502,53420,200705
is central for the health and well being of the nation.,502,53420,200705
Sport is part also of our unique cultural heritage.,502,53420,200705
Over the last decade we are proud to have been part of a Government that has delivered huge increases in financial support for sport and sporting infrastructure,502,53420,200705
throughout the country and across all sports.,502,53420,200705
"Since 1997 we have invested almost €1 billion in sport, with an increase of over 30% in the budget for sport in 2007 - providing in excess of €316m.",502,53420,200705
Our sport policy is aimed at encouraging and facilitating increased participation,502,53420,200705
and access to sport,502,53420,200705
"and physical activity by providing community-based, multi-faceted sports facilities at local level- for all.",502,53420,200705
"Increased participation plays a vital role in promoting physical and mental health,",504,53420,200705
"fitness,",502,53420,200705
"positive social interactions, skill enhancement,",606,53420,200705
and general well being,502,53420,200705
- as well as helping to reduce the likelihood of anti-social behaviour.,502,53420,200705
"Research shows that participation in sport improves general behaviour,",502,53420,200705
"respect for authority, discipline, attention levels, self-confidence and attitude to peers.",502,53420,200705
Recent ESRI research carried out on behalf of the Irish Sports Council shows that a large proportion of the population are not gaining the full health benefits of participation in sport.,502,53420,200705
The single largest barrier to participation is the lack of facilities;,502,53420,200705
"specifically safe, affordable indoor recreational facilities, where the participants and community have a sense of ownership.",502,53420,200705
Such facilities can provide a focal point to develop social cohesion and community spirit.,502,53420,200705
Invest €991 million in sports infrastructure under the National Development Plan.,502,53420,200705
Development of the national centre of excellence for sport,502,53420,200705

Provision of sport and recreational facilities on a nationwide basis,502,53420,200705
Continued development of horse and greyhound racing industries,502,53420,200705
Develop a network of Community Sports Complexes (CSC) across the country to facilitate the Lifelong Involvement in Sport & Physical Activity (LISPA) Model proposed by the Irish Sports Council.,502,53420,200705
Invest National Development Plan and other sports capital funds to provide these new facilities.,502,53420,200705
"Construct five pilot CSC projects, one each, in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, each fully funded by the State.",502,53420,200705
"Thereafter, hold tendering competitions for State subsidy to construct and manage each CSC across the country.",502,53420,200705
Ring-fence land / facilities available under Party’s State assets management policy (see earlier section) for CSCs where appropriate.,502,53420,200705
Ensure each CSC contains facilities for active participation in as wide a range of sports as possible.,502,53420,200705
Ensure each CSC is staffed with qualified NCEF (National Certificate in Exercise and Fitness) personnel.,502,53420,200705
Make the management of each complex an exercise in local democracy.,301,53420,200705
Each CSC will be managed by the local community with a clear charter of direction to ensure maximum benefit to the community.,502,53420,200705
"Introduce a Holistic Education & Activity Development Scheme (HEADS), which will see the creation of a Corps of Professional Trainers to co-ordinate voluntary youth activity in communities to provide support and expertise to community groups.",502,53420,200705
This will strengthen communities and help prevent the rise of anti-social behaviour.,502,53420,200705
Provide seed-capital funding to encourage the establishment of more youth cafés across the country.,706,53420,200705
We recognise the importance of Ireland’s cultural heritage,502,53420,200705
and support continued provision of the capital infrastructure for our national cultural institutions.,502,53420,200705
We also seek the development of the private sector cultural industry via appropriate financial support for projects to improve the cultural infrastructure in Ireland.,502,53420,200705
"In 2007, over €216m is being provided for arts and cultural projects in Ireland.",502,53420,200705
We have delivered unprecedented level funding for arts and culture and will continue to confirm our support for the arts and culture via significant funding over the lifetime of the next government.,502,53420,200705
Almost 1. 6 million people in the Republic of Ireland can speak Irish,502,53420,200705
"and 92% of people surveyed feel that promoting the Irish language is important to the country, to themselves personally or to both,",502,53420,200705
and the Progressive Democrats share that view.,502,53420,200705
In government we have affirmed our support for the development and preservation of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht in the Statement On The Irish Language 2006.,502,53420,200705
"Creideann muid go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag an nGaeilge do mhuintir, do shochaí agus do chultúr na hÉireann.",502,53420,200705

"The Party believes that the Irish language is of particular importance for the people, society and culture of Ireland.",502,53420,200705

This will facilitate the prioritization of infrastructural development,411,53520,200705
and the provision of services in order to aid housing development in towns and villages outside the main population centres.,411,53520,200705
We will provide greater investment in sewage services and wastewater treatment throughout the country.,411,53520,200705
It should be a clear policy objective that all waste water treatment should be brought to the point where waste water can be returned to the ecosystem without causing any risk to the environment,501,53520,200705
or to human health.,501,53520,200705

"is not in use by the Department or Agency that owns it,",0,53520,200705
"and is not considered as crucial to the development of that Department or Agency,",0,53520,200705
"for the provision of housing, including affordable housing.",504,53520,200705
We will recognise the continued need for Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) as a mechanism for the provision of high-quality accommodation in a short time frame.,504,53520,200705
"We will, however, shift policy away from RAS toward the provision of State-owned social housing,",504,53520,200705
"through construction and acquisition,",303,53520,200705
shifting resources away from payments to landlord and towards investment in housing assets.,303,53520,200705

We will permit two exceptions to this rule;,0,53520,200705
"In areas where private development is the exception to the norm, units can be foregone and developers can instead provide facilities such as community,",506,53520,200705

"However, this will only be with the agreement of Housing Ireland and the Minister.",303,53520,200705
"Where the local authority believes there is neither a need nor demand for social housing in or around a new development, and where there is a shortage of social and affordable units elsewhere in the local authority area, permission may be sought from Housing Ireland and the Minister to accept a cash payment.",504,53520,200705
The case for lack of demand will have to be proven to the Minister’s satisfaction and details provided of where and when the cash will be spent and affordable and social housing units delivered.,504,53520,200705

We will simplify stamp duty rates for all buyers by reducing the number of rates from 7 to 3.,402,53520,200705
"The new rates will be 0%, 5% and 9%.",402,53520,200705
We will make stamp duty fairer,402,53520,200705
so that you pay the higher rate only on the portion of the price over each threshold and not on the entire purchase price.,402,53520,200705
"Under Fine Gael’s proposals, the first €100,000 is zero rated,",0,53520,200705
"the next €350,000 is paid at 5%",0,53520,200705
and the balance is charged at 9%.,0,53520,200705
This means that major savings are made on stamp duty costs at each house price level.,0,53520,200705

We will ensure that prisoners earn their remission,605,53520,200705
"and are not automatically released early,",605,53520,200705
thereby incentivising positive behaviour such as taking part in courses or rehabilitation programmes while in prison.,605,53520,200705
We will guarantee that every prisoner will have access to a rehabilitative programme,605,53520,200705
so that he or she has the option to break the cycle of crime and to ensure that prisons do not act as schools for criminals.,605,53520,200705
"We will ensure that prisoners are ready for release and that they have options other than a return to crime by providing greater access to skills training and education than ever before,",506,53520,200705
thereby breaking the vicious circle of re-offending.,605,53520,200705
We will crack down on drug use in prisons,605,53520,200705
and provide real treatment programmes for inmates who suffer from addiction.,504,53520,200705
We will also provide for separation of drug-free inmates from those receiving treatment.,605,53520,200705
We will take action to reduce the current rate of re-offending from 75% so that criminals who go to prison don’t leave and commit more crime.,605,53520,200705
"We will provide alternative staged release programmes so that (particularly long-term) inmates are gradually re-introduced into society,",605,53520,200705
and so that they have options other than a return to a life of crime.,605,53520,200705
We will produce a schedule of rights that victims can expect when dealing with the criminal justice system,605,53520,200705

We will ensure that the victim(s) and/or their families are kept updated on how the case against their alleged perpetrator is progressing and on prison release dates.,605,53520,200705
We will require that rights of the victim are vindicated during the sentencing process and that a ‘plea in prosecution’ is put forward from the DPP with a view to achieving clarity in the mind of the judge and to assist him or her in his or her function.,605,53520,200705
"We will ensure that the prosecution automatically makes submissions regarding sentencing precedents at the sentencing stage (whether requested by the judge or not),",605,53520,200705
"highlighting, in particular, any aggravating factors.",605,53520,200705
We will ensure that victims of serious crime will be compensated for criminal wrongs committed against them through reform of the current system of compensation.,605,53520,200705
"We will allow victims, wherever appropriate, to avail of restorative justice measures with three main benefits:",605,53520,200705
"putting the victim centre stage (to the extent they wish), seeking to bring home to the accused an appreciation of the damage that he or she has done,",605,53520,200705
and reducing the rate of re-offending by those who take part in this process (which evidence suggests is significantly lower).,605,53520,200705
We will require offenders (young people and first-time offenders in particular) to face up to their crime in a very concrete and challenging manner without the necessity for criminal convictions,605,53520,200705
and custodial sentences that are expensive and sometimes counter-productive.,605,53520,200705

"Spending growth peaked at 22% in 2001, just before the last election and is projected to accelerate again to 13% in this election year.",305,53520,200705
This rate of spending growth has been far ahead of the growth in the economy and is not sustainable.,414,53520,200705
There is a requirement to slow growth in day-to-day spending down towards the rate of growth in the economy.,414,53520,200705
Fine Gael gives greater care and attention,303,53520,200705

We will build the capability of our public service to manage the challenges thrown up by a programme of reform.,303,53520,200705
We will open up recruitment within the public service and in particular within the civil service.,303,53520,200705

We will ensure that performance management and pay systems are directly tied to the achievement of high-level targets.,303,53520,200705
We will put in place a rolling review of existing public sector agencies to establish the scope for greater efficiency,303,53520,200705
"through reforming the existing legal codes under which they operate,",303,53520,200705
through sharing of services,303,53520,200705
and through examining the continuing relevance of the agencies’ targets and operations.,303,53520,200705

"and what targets it is setting and achieving, and to hold monthly meetings to monitor and sustain progress.",303,53520,200705
"We will ensure that each Government Department provides a Technical Support Unit to assist local agencies in this work identifying sources of international best practice,",303,53520,200705
promulgating success,303,53520,200705

and performance and of benchmarking service delivery against international benchmarks of best practice.,303,53520,200705
We will delegate greater responsibility and promote a dispersed model of public service with more user choice and more diversity.,303,53520,200705
We will require that contracting out be assessed by public sector managers as one way of delivering greater efficiency.,303,53520,200705
More innovation and local initiative to achieve best practice will be promoted.,303,53520,200705
We will use Limited Life Task Groups with a specified termination date to tackle dogged problems.,303,53520,200705
These teams will draw from people with experience on the ground,303,53520,200705
and aim to move away from office bound approaches limited by the rigid silo systems of the parent departments who ought to be cooperating in delivering tailored and integrated responses,303,53520,200705
"We will use technology to improve the delivery of important public services,",303,53520,200705
such as taxation and social welfare.,303,53520,200705

The comparison will include a quantification of the value of deferred pay under public and private sector pension arrangements.,303,53520,200705

We will seek to identify alternative opportunities for decentralisation where current proposals are found wanting but which have the potential to succeed given a sensible and well planned timescale.,303,53520,200705

We will reverse the decision to move some of the core policy planning units of government departments away from Dublin City.,303,53520,200705
It would undermine the continuing effectiveness of policy development.,303,53520,200705

Fine Gael in Opposition has led the campaign since we launchedripoff.ie in November 2003.,401,53520,200705

Any requested increases beyond the rate of inflation will require a Public Interest Report be presented to the Dáil.,303,53520,200705
This will apply even where a regulator approves the changes.,403,53520,200705
"This Report must provide an efficiency audit of the agency,",305,53520,200705

"We will index the jurisdictional limits of all the various courts to inflation,",605,53520,200705
so as to avoid the cost escalation associated with legal actions being driven into higher courts by inflation.,605,53520,200705
We will impose an obligation on all professional services providers to provide pricing details to clients,403,53520,200705

Over the last decade we have implemented the largest sustained increase in funding for the Arts in our history.,502,53620,200705
Arts Council funding was increased to 380 million in 2007.,502,53620,200705
This builds on earlier increases of about 80% between 1997 and 2002.,502,53620,200705
"There have also been significant increases in expenditure for our National cultural institutions,",502,53620,200705

"For example, our Arts Act 2003 defined for the first time in law the role and functions of government in relation to the promotion of the arts inside and outside the State.",502,53620,200705

Roll out ACCESS II.,502,53620,200705
We believe that each tradition on this island is entitled to commemorate its past with dignity and respect for others.,607,53620,200705
In recent years we have worked to allow the public of this state to honour those who sacrificed so much for the achievement of independence.,502,53620,200705
The state commemoration at Easter 2006 amply justified this policy.,502,53620,200705
"In light of the seminal importance of 1916, in government we will:",601,53620,200705
Push forward with plans for a substantial commemoration in the lead up to 2016.,601,53620,200705

Ireland has a deep tradition of active engagement by its citizens in every aspect of our national life and culture.,502,53620,200705
"During decades when the capacity of the State was limited by a lack of resources, it was the commitment of the Irish people that so often, formally and informally,",601,53620,200705
provided social services,606,53620,200705
and community leadership as well as a sporting and cultural life for our people.,601,53620,200705
"In today’s more prosperous Ireland, we need to identify and understand how public policy helps and hinders active engagement.",606,53620,200705
"We need to identify practical steps to encourage more of our people to become involved, and to stay involved, in the life of their own community.",606,53620,200705
"In government, we have prioritised the promotion of volunteerism in communities with the publication of the Report of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.",606,53620,200705
Over the last ten years we have implemented a systematic programme of reform concerning the regulation and oversight of public life in Ireland.,304,53620,200705
We believe that these measures have already had a substantial impact on ending many of the practices which have been exposed through detailed investigation.,304,53620,200705
We have been willing to go much further than most states in allowing investigations into affairs which are in some cases decades old.,304,53620,200705
The Garda Síochána Act 2005 which provided for the establishment of an independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and Garda Síochána Inspectorate –,304,53620,200705
the first ever independent oversight of the force.,304,53620,200705
Electoral Acts which have limited and audited donations and introduced serious penalties for the misuse of political funding.,304,53620,200705
Political donations must now be channelled into a special account and it is an offence not to do so.,304,53620,200705
The Standards in Public Office Commission is in place to investigate breaches.,304,53620,200705

and that citizens can have full confidence in the regulation of all parts of our democratic system.,202,53620,200705
This is why we are proposing a series of next steps forward for public life.,303,53620,200705
"Vigorously implement and improve, where necessary, the full range of ethics legislation.",304,53620,200705
"Implement comprehensive reform of the legislation governing Tribunals of Inquiry so that all future Tribunals operate in accordance with modern and efficient management practices,",303,53620,200705
"with focused terms of reference, and in a manner which ensures that the costs and duration of Tribunals are known and controlled.",303,53620,200705
Act on the findings of all Tribunals which have yet to report.,304,53620,200705
Establish an independent Electoral Commission to take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight.,202,53620,200705
"This Commission will have the function of implementing modern efficient practices for the conduct of elections,",303,53620,200705
becoming a standing Constituency Commission for the revision of constituency boundaries.,202,53620,200705
It will also take charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register,304,53620,200705
"and, due to its expertise, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office in relation to electoral expenditure.",202,53620,200705
"We will, in its terms of reference, stress the importance of avoiding, where at all possible, the division of small counties or small parts of counties into separate constituencies.",301,53620,200705
Submit the proposal for re-uniting Leitrim in a single Dáil constituency as a formal Fianna Fáil submission to the Constituency Commission.,301,53620,200705
Determine the extent of cross-party agreement on the recommendations of the Report on Seanad Reform to advance proposals for implementation.,202,53620,200705
Local government in Ireland has been transformed over the past decade.,301,53620,200705
19th century structures have been replaced with modern management systems to meet the needs of today.,301,53620,200705
"Local government has led the way in many areas including the first public sector Service Indicators,",301,53620,200705
eplanning systems and a new stronger role in community and enterprise development.,301,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil will build on this reform by making local government more transparent and more responsive to its customers.,303,53620,200705
required response times for correspondence;,303,53620,200705
‘customer friendly’ opening hours;,303,53620,200705
"telephone responses from real people, not machines;",303,53620,200705
customer training programmes; and,303,53620,200705
a right of appeal or review of local authority decisions for customers as a further step to greater transparency.,303,53620,200705
These changes will be set out in a Local Authority Customer Service Charter.,303,53620,200705
We will ensure that advice given in pre-planning discussions is consistentand does not get overturned every time there is a change in planning staff.,303,53620,200705
Taxpayers and ratepayers need to know that they are getting value for money.,303,53620,200705
We will modernise the financial and budgetary processes of local authorities so that councillors and the public can readily grasp the options open to the local authority when it comes to spending and revenue raising priorities.,303,53620,200705
"We will complement this initiative by ensuring that local authority spending is overseen by powerful Audit Committees, much like the Public Accounts Committee of Dáil Éireann, with power to summon witnesses and call local authorities to account.",303,53620,200705
These committees will include strong external membership with business/accounting experience.,303,53620,200705
We will build on the experience gained from the Service Indicators initiative by putting in place more challenging indicators for the years ahead,303,53620,200705
Including additional indicators on environmental performance and water quality.,416,53620,200705
We will review the operation of local government legislation to ensure that the decision making processes in local authorities,303,53620,200705
are rebalanced in favour of the democratically elected representatives of the people.,202,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil has massively increased investment in the frontline library and fire services. We will ensure that:,411,53620,200705
The library service responds to changing public demand for services as a result of the revolution in communications technology; and,411,53620,200705
The fire services operate to best international standards with a new community focus on fire prevention.,301,53620,200705
"Based on our republican ethos and building on the agenda for equality to which we are committed, we will address the need to provide a legal framework that supports the rights of same sex couples,",705,53620,200705
including by extending State recognition to civil partnerships between such persons so that they can live in a supportive and secure legal environment.,705,53620,200705
Today Ireland stands as one of the world’s greatest economies.,410,53620,200705
"We enjoy the full employment, the good wages and the promising opportunities which the generations that secured our independence could only dream of.",0,53620,200705
"Now, the challenge of our generation is to secure our prosperity and use it as a base on which we can build a better Ireland.",0,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil has always recognised that a strong economy is the essential precursor to social progress and service excellence.,410,53620,200705
"To meet that objective, we will ensure that Ireland is one of the most attractive places in the world in which to live, to learn, to work and to invest.",410,53620,200705
"To strengthen our society’s foundations, we will ensure that our taxation system rewards work and enterprise rather than punishes them.",402,53620,200705

"Under Fianna Fáil, Ireland’s economy will generate new and better opportunities and provide new and better resources for all the people of our country.",410,53620,200705
"Our Next Steps Forward will deliver the dynamic, sustainable and progressive economy that will make this possible.",410,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil in government has led the transformation of Ireland’s economy.,410,53620,200705
"We have moved from being a high-unemployment, high-tax and low public investment country to having the lowest unemployment, lowest taxes on workers and highest rate of public investment in Europe.",305,53620,200705
"We reject the shallow ideologies of right and left, believing that a strong economy,",410,53620,200705
the promotion of individual enterprise,401,53620,200705
and increasing investment in public services,504,53620,200705
are fundamentally linked objectives.,0,53620,200705
"Unemployment has been reduced to an historic low, with long-term unemployment now at only 1.3%.",408,53620,200705
"A systematic programme of income tax cuts has been implemented, reducing the top rate from 48% to 41%",402,53620,200705
and the lower rate from 26% to 20%.,402,53620,200705
"Investment in public services has been step-changed, with dramatic increases in the State Pension,",504,53620,200705
child benefit,504,53620,200705
"and the numbers of teachers,",506,53620,200705
"Gardaí,",504,53620,200705
doctors,504,53620,200705
and nurses at work.,411,53620,200705
Investment in public infrastructure has been set at the highest level in Europe as a percentage of national income.,504,53620,200705
A fund now totalling 319 billion has been created to ensure that we can continue to pay decent pensions in the years ahead.,414,53620,200705
All of this has been achieved while delivering budget surpluses in nine of the last ten years.,414,53620,200705
Today a full 31 billion per year less is paid in debt interest than was paid in 1997,414,53620,200705
"– money which is supporting a sustained level of higher investment in public services. In government, Fianna Fáil will continue to implement policies that deliver sustainable expansion allowing Ireland to exploit the opportunities presented in good times and to withstand pressure during times of international economic weakness.",414,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil will always put responsibility first.,414,53620,200705
"All the commitments made in this manifesto are dependent on our country’s continuing prosperity, something which we will never put at risk.",414,53620,200705
The long-term interests of Ireland are our priority and will never be sacrificed for short-term gain.,414,53620,200705
A sound economy is the bedrock of social progress.,414,53620,200705
"It is an absolute prerequisite for all our ambitions – in health, enterprise, welfare or education. To that end, Fianna Fáil in government will defend prosperity with unrivalled determination.",414,53620,200705
"The consequences of that determination are clear: if Ireland ever faces into a global economic downturn we will act prudently, as before.",0,53620,200705
"We will deliver this country through any downturn with healthy fundamentals intact – that is, to maintain the lowest unemployment, lowest taxes and highest growth in Europe.",410,53620,200705
Sound budgetary management is essential if Ireland is to continue enjoying low taxes,414,53620,200705
and high levels of spending on public goods and services.,414,53620,200705
All of our proposals for the next five years have been framed within the context of a very clear set of assumptions which show exactly how we will approach fiscal and economic decisions over a full term of government.,414,53620,200705
"Our programme will involve us taxing, spending and borrowing less than the opposition – but while we are promising less, we will deliver more.",414,53620,200705
Long-term responsibility is the foundation on which our economic policy is built.,414,53620,200705
We will not mortgage our country’s future for short-term gain.,414,53620,200705
Our economic policy must accept the reality that we cannot and should not compete on the basis of low wages.,411,53620,200705
"If we are to compete effectively and in a sustainable way, we will have to do so through even greater competitiveness in knowledgedriven industries.",408,53620,200705
This is the best and only serious guarantee of high employment and high wages.,410,53620,200705
"We will aim to achieve further significant, sustainable growth with our programme based on an average growth rate of 4.5%.",410,53620,200705
We will operate a responsible fiscal policy characterised by broad budget balance and a declining debt burden.,414,53620,200705
"We will deliver the National Development Plan in full, on time and within budget to raise our productivity,",411,53620,200705
to enhance our competitiveness,414,53620,200705
and to secure our future prosperity.,414,53620,200705
"We will invest in increasing the productive capacity of the economy, particularly in terms of ensuring high-levels of high-quality employment.",414,53620,200705
Sound budgetary management is essential,414,53620,200705
if Ireland is to continue enjoying low taxes and high levels of spending on public goods and services.,0,53620,200705
Our guiding principles for fiscal policy for the next five years are to:,0,53620,200705
Keep the budget in broad balance,414,53620,200705
and fully within our commitments under the Stability & Growth Pact.,414,53620,200705
Retain the flexibility to deal with any future shocks.,414,53620,200705
Set aside a minimum of 1% of GNP per annum to provide for the future pensions of today’s workers.,504,53620,200705
"Implement a series of significant and sustainable increases in key public services such as pensions,",504,53620,200705
health,504,53620,200705
and schools.,506,53620,200705
Keep the overall tax burden low,402,53620,200705
and implement further changes to enhance the rewards of work,402,53620,200705
while increasing the fairness of the tax system.,503,53620,200705
"Once our current prosperity is safeguarded, policy must seek to build for the future by raising our productive capacity",410,53620,200705
and in so doing improve our potential to enjoy a better quality of life.,0,53620,200705
That is the context in which the new National Development Plan was framed.,404,53620,200705
"With a total cost of 3184 billion over seven years, the Plan involves a major acceleration of Government capital investment.",411,53620,200705
"The period to 2013 represents a major window of opportunity in resource terms to tackle, in particular, our infrastructure deficits before other expenditure pressures begin to emerge.",411,53620,200705
At present Ireland has six persons of working age for every older person.,0,53620,200705
This will gradually disimprove over the medium-term so that by 2050 we will have ratio of just two to one.,504,53620,200705
"The implications of this are that public spending on pensions, health and long-term care in Ireland will increase from some 10½% of GDP in 2004 to almost 20% of GDP in 2050.",504,53620,200705
"Clearly, we now have a unique opportunity to give Ireland the infrastructure it needs and deserves if we are to sustain our current prosperity into the future while simultaneously enhancing quality of life.",411,53620,200705
We must not allow that opportunity to pass us by.,0,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil believes that the full implementation of the NDP must be the first priority of the next administration,411,53620,200705
and should take precedence over short-termist promises or gestures.,0,53620,200705
The NDP will make our economy and our society stronger,410,53620,200705
and will substantially increase the probability that our good fortune will benefit future generations.,410,53620,200705
"It will protect and sustain our prosperity, not threaten it.",410,53620,200705
Ireland is now an income-rich country.,410,53620,200705
"However, we are still poor in terms of our public wealth due to decades of under-investment in infrastructure.",411,53620,200705
"To correct this imbalance, Fianna Fáil in government has committed to investing 5.4% of GNP in public infrastructure through the NDP.",411,53620,200705
"This will be implemented through a coordinated, multi-annual programme which is subject to rigorous value for money and quality oversight.",411,53620,200705
"Through sound management of the economy, Fianna Fáil will ensure that this resource commitment is maintained over the lifetime of the next government.",411,53620,200705
Closing the infrastructure gap as expeditiously as possible has significant benefits,411,53620,200705
and will enhance quality of life and economic competitiveness for generations to come.,410,53620,200705
We will deliver the public infrastructure which this country needs if it is to sustain and consolidate the gains of the past decade.,411,53620,200705
Ireland’s future prosperity is critically dependent on our ability to trade with the world.,407,53620,200705
"Fianna Fáil will underpin Ireland’s success as a highly-productive, trading nation by the following measures:",407,53620,200705
"Through the National Development Plan, we will invest over 38.2 billion in Science, Technology and Innovation.",411,53620,200705
This investment will transform the type of R&D and innovation taking place across our enterprise sector.,411,53620,200705

Our approach will be to ensure that any initial costs for higher standards are offset by the long-term savings in running costs.,0,53620,200705
Fianna Fáil emphatically believes that there is no such thing as an acceptable or inevitable level of crime.,605,53620,200705
"We believe that ensuring that people feel safe in their homes, workplaces and communities must always be a fundamental objective of government.",605,53620,200705

We have also understood the importance of preventative measures – implementing a new approach to youth diversion and prisoner rehabilitation.,605,53620,200705
A steadily rising population leads to many pressures – as do international trends in terms of drugs and firearms.,0,53620,200705
"While we reject efforts to caricature and demonise young people, the simple fact is that certain types of anti-social behaviour are today more prevalent.",606,53620,200705
This requires a willingness to adapt policies and continue to innovate in order to protect the interests of the community.,606,53620,200705
Therefore we are proposing a series of next steps forward to promote justice in our country.,605,53620,200705
Anyone who claims there’s a simple answer to the issue of crime doesn’t understand the nature of crime.,605,53620,200705
We are absolutely committed to a firm but fair approach which is based on three fundamental policies:,605,53620,200705
Prevention - We believe in investing money to try and stop people becoming riminals in the first place.,504,53620,200705
Policing - A strong Garda presence in every community is a central part of promoting public order and giving public peace of mind.,605,53620,200705
"Punishment - People who commit crimes deserve to be punished, both through spending time in prison",605,53620,200705
and participating in programmes capable of achieving real rehabilitation.,504,53620,200705
Prisons help to make us safe by removing offenders from our streets.,605,53620,200705
But they can also reduce crime by rehabilitating prisoners and stopping them re-offending.,504,53620,200705
Invest significantly in rehabilitation for prisoners.,504,53620,200705
We will set annual rehabilitation goals and targets.,504,53620,200705

"Such programmes will consist of work, counselling, health services and education modules as well as offence-based programs.",504,53620,200705
Ensure that prisoner remission will only be earned by participation in rehabilitation programmes.,605,53620,200705
Refusal to participate will result in loss of remission.,605,53620,200705
The current 25% remission will be reduced to 10%.,605,53620,200705
Remission higher than 10% will only be available where rehabilitation programmes are successfully completed,605,53620,200705
and the offence did not involve violence.,605,53620,200705
"Put in place similar conditions for those on remission as exist for those on bail regarding where they reside, who they associate with etc.",605,53620,200705

There are alternatives to prisons for certain categories of non-violent petty offenders.,605,53620,200705
They should be expected to make amends to the people and communities they have harmed.,605,53620,200705
All restorative justice schemes will operate in co-operation with the Gardaí and Courts.,605,53620,200705

"These would include cleaning streets, painting over graffiti, repairing public facilities, etc.",605,53620,200705
"Give victims and communities a greater say in what work offenders do as part of their community service, including, where appropriate, direct reparation in cash or kind.",605,53620,200705

"Rapidly improve the ratio of civilian staff to Garda officers across all areas of the organisation, including specialist areas, thereby releasing further Gardaí to visible, frontline policing duties in the community.",605,53620,200705

Introduce conditions governing the use by a suspect of the Garda interview video.,605,53620,200705
Contravening these will be a criminal offence.,605,53620,200705
"While the current National Drugs Strategy will be reviewed in 2008, the focus of drugs policy in the coming years will continue to be on illegal drugs that do the most harm and on the most vulnerable drug misusers, their families and communities.",605,53620,200705

This position is changing fast.,0,53620,200705
"In recent years the largest programme of building, refurbishment, recruitment, service development and structural reform in the history of our health services has been underway.",504,53620,200705

– the core objective of any health service.,0,53620,200705

Help people to maintain good health through health promoting initiatives and a new Personal Health Check entitlement.,504,53620,200705

It has already delivered substantial improvements in the early detection and successful treatment of breast cancer.,504,53620,200705

"In general, we believe the interests of public patients must be protected",504,53620,200705
and that the best way to do this is to invest in expanded services,504,53620,200705
and to end practices which serve to reduce public capacity and make effective management difficult.,303,53620,200705
"Increase the number of dedicated public-only hospital beds by 1,500.",504,53620,200705
500 will be provided through the public capital programme,504,53620,200705
"and 1,000 by moving private practice to separate facilities.",504,53620,200705
Implement the plans for co-located facilities because this represents the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that public capacity is both increased and ring-fenced.,504,53620,200705
It also represents the only serious way of implementing a comprehensive reform of the consultant contract.,504,53620,200705
Ensure that the Patient Treatment Register is operated for all in and out-patient referrals.,504,53620,200705

or the children of a marriage from being adopted by loving parents.,706,53620,200705
The new Article will also greatly strengthen the protection we afford to children by permitting the carefully regulated exchange of information about suspected child abusers and by allowing the Oireachtas to introduce legislation which would make it impossible for those who take sexual advantage of children to claim the defence of honest mistake about the age of their victims.,605,53620,200705

We have also established the Garda Central Vetting Unit to ensure that those working with children are screened.,706,53620,200705
Our proposed amendment to the Constitution will further strengthen our ability to protect our children by allowing the Oireachtas to legislate for the exchange of information about suspected child abusers.,706,53620,200705
It will also allow for the creation of offences of absolute or strict liability so that those who sexually abuse our children will no longer be able to claim mistake about their victims’ age as a defence in court.,706,53620,200705

Over the last ten years we have used the unprecedented resources generated through sound economic policies to implement a systematic programme of improvements in social supports.,504,53620,200705

The emphasis will be on the provision of appropriate long-term housing solutions rather than on moving retention thresholds at which some or all of the social welfare payment is lost.,504,53620,200705

This has brought with it many challenges in a country such as Ireland where there has been no significant historical experience of dealing with immigration.,607,53620,200705
It has also brought new opportunities to broaden our social and cultural horizons.,607,53620,200705

More recently Sinn Féin made an agreement with the DUP and the historic first public meeting between Sinn Féin and the DUP took place in Stormont.,0,53951,200705
Since then Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley have been working together to prepare for the return of the power-sharing institutions.,0,53951,200705

"and the Executive with a Deputy First Minister and Junior Minister, a Minister for Education, a Minister for Agriculture and a Minister for Regional Development.",0,53951,200705
We have commenced the process of jointly governing the 6 Counties,101,53951,200705
and the all-Ireland political institutions,101,53951,200705
and we are committed to do our part to ensure this succeeds.,101,53951,200705
Our negotiators also continue to work tirelessly to bring about further progress in ongoing talks with the Irish and British Governments and with unionists.,101,53951,200705
"Over the past decade, republicans have proven our ability to negotiate successfully.",305,53951,200705
We have shown leadership by taking major and sometimes difficult decisions in the national interest.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin has brought a new energy and a new dynamic to Irish politics,305,53951,200705
and there is a lot more we want to deliver.,305,53951,200705
"One of the best ways for Irish citizens to assist further progress in the process towards a lasting peace,",106,53951,200705

We propose that the incoming Irish Government begin the practical planning now by producing a Green Paper on Irish Unity.,601,53951,200705
"This should commence with a process of comprehensive consultation, engagement, persuasion and negotiation with a view to securing active and widespread support for a future United Ireland.",601,53951,200705
"By definition such a process must involve all the people of this island,",0,53951,200705
including all of the social partners that constitute civil society.,202,53951,200705
It must involve a process of dialogue with unionists on the basis of mutual respect.,202,53951,200705
It must by necessity involve a negotiation with the British Government,601,53951,200705
and a meaningful and substantial Peace Dividend from both Governments.,601,53951,200705
"It also needs to have an international dimension seeking specific forms of support from popular and political opinion in Britain,",107,53951,200705
the Irish diaspora and the international community.,107,53951,200705
"In addition to the proposed Green Paper process, we would immediately extend representation and the franchise to the 6 Counties electorate,",101,53951,200705

"Secure a referendum on Irish Unity to be held simultaneously, north and south.",601,53951,200705
"When people elect a Government to act on their behalf and pay taxes to fund Government initiatives and programmes,",504,53951,200705
they rightly expect and deserve provision of public services in return.,504,53951,200705
That is what the Social Contract is all about.,504,53951,200705
"In Celtic Tiger Ireland, however, essential services are not made available equally to all.",503,53951,200705
"Rather, the quality of services available to you depends increasingly on your ability to pay over and above your taxes.",503,53951,200705
"Despite ample wealth in the State, public provision is shrinking",504,53951,200705
and double taxation for services in the form of service charges and user fees is on the rise.,504,53951,200705
"The net result is unequal two-tier healthcare,",504,53951,200705
"housing,",504,53951,200705
education and childcare.,504,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that one of the most fundamental roles of Government is to make world class public services,504,53951,200705
"– including and especially the basics: healthcare, housing, education and childcare – equally available to all as of right.",504,53951,200705
This is what we are committed to deliver for the people of Ireland.,504,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that healthcare is a fundamental human right.,201,53951,200705
We now have the resources in this State to realise this right for everyone:,504,53951,200705
"not only to ensure that all people have equal access to world class health services,",504,53951,200705
but also to effectively tackle the factors leading to poor health for many – social and economic inequality.,503,53951,200705
"While health spending has increased under the current Government, they have stubbornly maintained the unequal two-tier public-private system,",503,53951,200705
thus wasting public money in a system that is not only inequitable but inefficient.,305,53951,200705
"The symptoms of consequent crisis in our health services are well known – manifested in the scandalous situation in A&E units, long waiting lists and the shortage of beds and staff.",305,53951,200705
In an era of unprecedented wealth and spending on healthcare,504,53951,200705
the continued inequalities in health and in access to health services are inexcusable.,504,53951,200705
They are an indictment of successive Governments run by all the establishment parties.,305,53951,200705
Many parties now make claims about opposing the two-tier health system.,305,53951,200705
But only Sinn Féin has a credible plan to establish healthcare,305,53951,200705
on the basis of full equality.,503,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin proposes a new universal public health system for Ireland that provides care to all free at the point of delivery,",504,53951,200705
"on the basis of need alone,",504,53951,200705
and funded from general fair and progressive taxation.,503,53951,200705
"We are also proposing fundamental re-orientation of the health system to adopt a central focus on prevention, health promotion and primary care (including mental healthcare and full spectrum addiction treatment services),",504,53951,200705
"and on ultimately eliminating the underlying social and structural causes of ill-health and premature death, such as poverty and inequality.",503,53951,200705
We plan to restructure the health service to reconfigure delivery on an all-Ireland basis,601,53951,200705
"to make it more efficient and locally accessible, by introducing a single All-Ireland Strategic Health Executive to oversee all services.",503,53951,200705
And we plan to make delivery more responsive to the communities served by establishing locally accountable Community Health Partnerships,301,53951,200705
"bringing together public representatives, service users, advocates, health professionals and systems experts to collectively manage delivery of all local health services on the basis of need.",301,53951,200705
"We plan to enshrine the right to healthcare in the 1937 Constitution,",203,53951,200705
"in a future All-Ireland Charter of Rights and in legislation, making this a fully enforceable right in Irish courts.",201,53951,200705
"We also plan to establish a Health Ombudsman to provide an administrative remedy short of the courts,",504,53951,200705
in the interests of speedier and less expensive resolution of disputes,303,53951,200705
and redress regarding violations of the right to healthcare.,303,53951,200705
"Furthermore, we will introduce equality-proofing",503,53951,200705
and human rights-proofing,201,53951,200705
"to all health policy, law and practice, and public health-proofing of other areas of law and policy.",0,53951,200705
"Of course, pursuing the other aspects of our economic and social programme will increase social and economic equality",503,53951,200705
and therefore have a positive impact on health outcomes for all our people.,504,53951,200705
"Our Dáil Team stood firm in support of the public system and public patients and led the fight against privatisation,",504,53951,200705

Sinn Féin believes that childcare is a right and policy must be geared to the needs of children and families,504,53951,200705
rather than solely to the needs of the labour market.,601,53951,200705
This State still has one of the lowest rates of childcare provision in the EU.,504,53951,200705
Childcare costs almost one third of the average disposable income of a double-income family.,504,53951,200705
It has become the ‘second mortgage’.,0,53951,200705
"Many families on lower incomes either cannot get childcare at all, or else must pay a disproportionate amount of their income on massive weekly childcare bills.",504,53951,200705
"The lack of quality, affordable childcare prevents many women who wish to do so from working outside the home.",706,53951,200705
There is an urgent need to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for childcare provision.,504,53951,200705
While some progress has been made since Sinn Féin first raised this demand in 2004 the Government has been far too slow,305,53951,200705
to act and progress has come very late in its term of office.,305,53951,200705
"We are proposing State-led provision of regulated comprehensive childcare,",504,53951,200705
"to be made available to all equally as of right,",503,53951,200705

"This will include universal early childhood education and care,",506,53951,200705
"universal pre-school for 3 to 5s,",506,53951,200705

"In addition, there needs to be a greater recognition of the economic and social value of parents providing full-time care directly.",706,53951,200705
"All parents who wish to spend the first year caring for their child full-time should have the right to be enabled to do so,",601,53951,200705
"and employers should provide more flexibility for working parents to provide childcare directly when necessary, without penalty.",504,53951,200705
We also propose that full-time family caring work should be recognised by the pension system through gender neutral Carers’ Credits.,504,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team sponsored a motion calling for the development of a comprehensive and accessible childcare infrastructure,504,53951,200705
"and a wide range of measures to assist parents, whether caring for children fulltime in the home or working outside the home",504,53951,200705

We consulted widely with the childcare sector before publishing our 2005 and 2006 pre-Budget priorities documents Putting Children First,305,53951,200705

Immediately establish a Childcare Funding Commission to report within a reasonable time-frame on the projected costs of the transition to a comprehensive all-Ireland system,504,53951,200705
of universal childcare provision and to make recommendations on how the State can best harness our resources in the interests of more equitable and efficient delivery.,604,53951,200705
Set a time-frame for the introduction of one year at 100% of pay and introduce two weeks paid paternity leave entitlements,504,53951,200705
(as an interim step towards four weeks leave) to harmonise these rights on an all-Ireland basis.,601,53951,200705
"Commission a study, including widespread public consultation, to determine the best way to support those parents whose work is in the home caring for their children.",504,53951,200705
Introduce gender neutral Carers’ Credits into the pension system.,504,53951,200705
Sinn Féin wants a strong economy,401,53951,200705
that is sustainable into the future.,416,53951,200705
We are committed to building and maintaining an economic environment that enhances enterprise and job creation,401,53951,200705

We believe in economic reintegration and sovereignty.,606,53951,200705
We believe in regional equality,601,53951,200705
and balanced regional development.,301,53951,200705
We know that achieving all these things will require government intervention and planning and public investment.,301,53951,200705
"Current Government policy has failed to address rising inflation,",404,53951,200705
an overreliance on foreign direct investment,404,53951,200705
and an over-dependence on the construction sector.,301,53951,200705
The government has failed to promote balanced regional development,411,53951,200705
and infrastructure and service provision is still not good enough in many parts of the State.,411,53951,200705
The levels of research and development (R&D) remain too low.,401,53951,200705
There is no coherent plan for developing indigenous business or for training and upskilling the workforce.,411,53951,200705
"There is a worrying and unacceptable move by some employers to sustain competitiveness on the back of low-paid and exploited migrant workers,",701,53951,200705
and the Government has not prevented this.,305,53951,200705
"Furthermore, the active dismantling of the public enterprise sector has impeded the economy overall:",413,53951,200705
for example the privatisation of Eircom significantly slowed broadband rollout.,413,53951,200705
"The Government has also failed to proactively plan to meet future challenges to the economy,",305,53951,200705
including specifically planning for workers employed in vulnerable sectors.,701,53951,200705
"According to the National Competitiveness Council, in the five years to March 2006 manufacturing industries lost over 32,000 jobs.",408,53951,200705
Many of the jobs lost in rural areas are not being replaced -,408,53951,200705
with devastating local effects.,408,53951,200705
Many of the new jobs cited by the Government as replacing those lost are only part-time.,408,53951,200705

Economic reunification and sovereignty is at the core of Sinn Féin economic policy.,601,53951,200705
Partition is wasteful and inefficient for the Irish economy as a whole.,601,53951,200705
It involves duplication of government and public service structures.,601,53951,200705
It imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on those wishing to do business in both jurisdictions.,303,53951,200705
"It means we are competing with ourselves for economic investment, as well",303,53951,200705

It is now widely recognised that our economic future depends on moving towards all-Ireland economic integration.,601,53951,200705
"Despite the recent lipservice given to all-Ireland development by the Government parties in particular,",601,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is unquestionably the party most committed to deliver this.,305,53951,200705
We also need to invest and plan for balanced regional development,301,53951,200705
so that no part of the country is excluded from the benefits of economic growth.,301,53951,200705
The State must make robust interventions to reverse the legacy of underinvestment and neglect and bring economic equality to the regions,301,53951,200705
"including and especially the Border, Midlands and West of the Shannon and the Bann.",301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin’s decision to choose the Ministry for Regional Development over other important portfolios,305,53951,200705

Sinn Féin proposes to accelerate all-Ireland economic reintegration pending reunification.,601,53951,200705

or social deprivation.,503,53951,200705
Infrastructure is one of the most important pillars of competitiveness in the global economy.,411,53951,200705
The Government has failed to give this sufficient priority despite having the resources available.,305,53951,200705
"The state of infrastructure continues to be an impediment to further, more regionally-balanced growth.",301,53951,200705
"Business and workers urgently need improved public transport provision,",411,53951,200705

Our transport system has never fully recovered from the closure of rail lines in the 1950s and 60s.,411,53951,200705
"Public transport continues to be severely under-funded,",411,53951,200705
"traffic gridlock is a chronic problem,",411,53951,200705
many areas lack railway provision,411,53951,200705

"Business and workers also need efficient and safe road networks,",411,53951,200705

but much of this development has been uneven and significant gaps remain.,411,53951,200705
"Enhanced air and sea port provision are also important to economic development,",601,53951,200705
and they deserve greater attention and State-led development on an all-Ireland basis.,411,53951,200705
Business needs communications infrastructure,410,53951,200705

We lag behind other states in broadband provision.,411,53951,200705
"As a result of the decision to privatise Eircom, we went from Europe’s second highest telecommunications technological availability",411,53951,200705
to 23rd in less than a decade.,413,53951,200705
"In addition, the imposition of cross-border mobile roaming charges is not reasonable and needs to end.",413,53951,200705
An Post provides a valuable and effective service that reaches everyone throughout the State,411,53951,200705
"and deserves safeguarding and diversification, not closures.",411,53951,200705
Business also needs affordable and reliable energy sources.,411,53951,200705
"The Government has failed to develop domestic energy production and all-Ireland networks,",416,53951,200705
and has allowed Ireland to remain overdependent on foreign and nonrenewable energy supplies,411,53951,200705
and thus captive to oil price rises.,416,53951,200705
The domestic renewable energy sector is underdeveloped despite huge potential.,411,53951,200705
Some areas of the country still do not have natural gas connectivity.,413,53951,200705
"In addition, rather than keeping electricity prices as low as possible in the public interest,",412,53951,200705
the Government has presided over unreasonable ESB increases as part of a cynical exercise in fattening the company for private sale.,411,53951,200705

Development of these strategic sectors which are so essential to continued economic growth,413,53951,200705
cannot be left to chance and to the market.,413,53951,200705
They can be efficiently and cost-effectively run by the public sector,413,53951,200705

and security of supply.,416,53951,200705
"Put an end to the artificial inflation of ESB prices,",412,53951,200705
which results from the energy regulator’s liberalisation remit,412,53951,200705
and puts an undue burden on small businesses in particular.,412,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that indigenous business development is crucial for a sustainable economy.,401,53951,200705
Under current Government policy the enterprise environment has actually deteriorated.,305,53951,200705
Businesses large and small are now feeling the pinch from the combined impact of poor infrastructure,411,53951,200705
"and gridlock and spiralling energy, insurance, water and waste management prices.",411,53951,200705
Smaller businesses get second class treatment.,0,53951,200705
"Only now, in the runup to the General Election, is the Government  finally beginning to take measures to promote R&D.",411,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is committed to supporting enterprise and job creation,401,53951,200705
and to balanced regional development.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin proposes a package of measures aimed specifically at supporting and developing indigenous enterprise.,401,53951,200705
We would continue to encourage more Foreign Direct Investment,401,53951,200705
but give the same type of supports to small and medium businesses.,401,53951,200705
We would also support agriculture which provides 20% of all jobs outside of the public sector.,703,53951,200705
We also believe that publicly-owned companies make an important contribution to the Irish economy and business environment,413,53951,200705
– particularly where these are established in strategic sectors – and moreover that these can be run both efficiently and profitably.,413,53951,200705
"We do not propose to continue the downsizing of the public sector in the 26 Counties,",413,53951,200705
but rather to retain profitable and especially strategic sector companies in public ownership,413,53951,200705
and to develop new companies where there is scope for this.,413,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team consistently opposed the privatisation of essential public utilities that are vital to a healthy business environment.,413,53951,200705
We consistently pressed for an increased focus on supporting indigenous industry,401,53951,200705
and promoting R&D amongst Irish companies.,411,53951,200705
We pushed for meaningful intervention where jobs were lost as multinational companies moved their operations to lower cost economies.,412,53951,200705
We demanded improved redundancy protections for workers,706,53951,200705
and that the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment carry out an assessment of the relevance of training courses provided by FÁS in meeting the needs of business and those seeking employment.,411,53951,200705
We called attention to Government failures to focus business development supports on areas such as County Donegal,301,53951,200705
that have experienced significant job losses and have above average levels of unemployment.,408,53951,200705
Support the development of indigenous micro and small and medium enterprises (SME) and social economy enterprises.,401,53951,200705
Establish an All-Ireland Small Business Task Force,601,53951,200705
to develop an islandwide strategy for the indigenous SME sector.,401,53951,200705

"including provision of increased business advice, guidance and training plus dedicated management development.",401,53951,200705
"Adopt an All-Ireland R&D Strategy co-ordinated through the enterprise development agencies,",411,53951,200705

"Adopt an All-Ireland Clustering Strategy that both targets the new emerging technologies and strengthens the potential in existing economic sectors such as financial services, agriculture and food processing.",408,53951,200705

(including a dedicated Co-operative Development Unit) to develop the sector strategically.,404,53951,200705
Ensure increased investment in community-owned enterprise units,401,53951,200705
and infrastructure by the enterprise development agencies.,411,53951,200705
"Provide specific government support for social economy community-run projects in the renewable energy, housing and agricultural sectors.",401,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that workers’ rights are basic requirements of a healthy economy and a just society.,701,53951,200705
We aim to end exploitation and unsafe working conditions,701,53951,200705
"and to ensure that everyone can have rewarding employment,",701,53951,200705
a fair income,503,53951,200705
and a good quality family life.,701,53951,200705
Government policy has steadily eroded workers’ rights over the last decade.,305,53951,200705
Employers displace well-paid workers for lower-paid labour because they can do so in the absence of strict regulation and stringent enforcement.,701,53951,200705
Evidence of exploitation involving abuse of migrant workers is mounting across the State.,701,53951,200705
Yet weak regulation and poor enforcement have resulted in low rates of inspection and prosecution for violations.,701,53951,200705
The rate of working households in poverty has doubled over the last decade as a result of low-paid employment.,503,53951,200705
"Non-enforcement, insufficient penalties and deficiencies in law all contribute to high-levels of work-related illness, injuries and fatalities.",701,53951,200705
"In 2005, 73 people lost their lives in work-related accidents.",701,53951,200705
Sinn Féin has established a new Trade Union Department,701,53951,200705
and published a detailed plan to bring workers’ rights back to the centre of economic and social policy.,701,53951,200705
Sinn Féin’s priority is to better the lot of all workers in Ireland.,701,53951,200705
"We advocate employment based on equality with fair conditions and a secure living wage,",701,53951,200705
"in a work environment that is safe, healthy and free from harassment and discrimination.",701,53951,200705
Rogue employers who  operate dangerous workplaces or unsafe work practices or who exploit workers and violate labour law in Ireland must be made subject to stringent penalties.,701,53951,200705
Employers must be made to recognise trade unions and trade unions’ right to organise recognised in law.,701,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin recognises that Irish workers and trade unions have legitimate concerns regarding ‘displacement’ by lower-paid workers, including migrant workers.",701,53951,200705
"‘Displacement’is not so much the exchange of Irish workers for non-Irish workers but the exchange of organised workers with good pay, conditions and benefits for unorganised workers who are ripe for exploitation.",701,53951,200705
"The solution to displacement therefore lies in regulating employment standards (including pay and working conditions) for all workers,",701,53951,200705
and their effective enforcement to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers for profit.,701,53951,200705
Sinn Féin also proposes enactment of a new generation of employment equality legislation.,503,53951,200705
"Particularly as we move towards an all-Ireland labour market,",601,53951,200705
we propose an upward-harmonisation of employment equality law – as well as all other workers’ rights – on an all-Ireland basis.,503,53951,200705
We plan to enshrine workers’ rights in the 1937 Constitution in a future All-Ireland Charter of Rights and in a United Irish Constitution.,701,53951,200705
"These will include the right of workers organise,",701,53951,200705
"to join trade unions,",701,53951,200705
"to negotiate contracts of employment, and to strike.",701,53951,200705
Sinn Féin would establish a Department and Minister of Labour.,701,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team published the Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2007 to make employers accountable for the death of an employee in the workplace as a result of negligence.,701,53951,200705
"We regularly called attention to cases of migrant worker exploitation,",701,53951,200705
"and proposed amendments to the Employment Permits Bill to enshrine equal rights for migrant workers,",701,53951,200705
to change the law so that all employment permits would be issued directly to the worker and to extend family reunification and employment rights.,701,53951,200705
We used the Private Members Time in the Dáil to initiate a debate calling for the establishment of a stand alone Department of Labour Affairs.,701,53951,200705
"In the Dáil Sinn Féin has consistently demanded government action on workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses.",701,53951,200705
Promoting Trade Union Rights,701,53951,200705
and Establishing a Department of Labour.,701,53951,200705
"Hold a referendum to enshrine in the 1937 Constitution the right of workers to form, join",701,53951,200705
"and be represented by trade unions,",701,53951,200705
"to negotiate contracts of employment, and to engage in industrial action and trade union activities.",701,53951,200705
This will have the effect of making trade union recognition mandatory.,701,53951,200705
Harmonise labour law upwards on an all-Ireland basis.,701,53951,200705
Establish a Department of Labour with a full Minister and a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Labour Affairs.,701,53951,200705

"Amend the law to provide that in all cases employment permits are issued directly to migrant workers and not their employers,",705,53951,200705
and to extend migrant workers’ rights to family reunification and employment.,705,53951,200705

Immediately enact corporate manslaughter legislation.,701,53951,200705
Develop a ten-year All-Ireland Health and Safety at Work Strategy.,404,53951,200705
Introduce a statutory right to request flexible working arrangements,701,53951,200705
that requires all employers to ‘seriously consider’ this and only permits refusal where there is a compelling business case.,701,53951,200705

Introduce subsidy and tax relief measures on the cost of workplace adaptations to accommodate workers with disabilities.,706,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that we need an economy that is not only strong but also equal.,503,53951,200705
The world’s most equal economies are also among the most stable and prosperous.,503,53951,200705
That is what we want for our country.,601,53951,200705
The 26 Counties may have become one of the world’s richest state but it is also one of the most unequal.,503,53951,200705
The policies of successive Irish Governments have created an economy in which the wealthiest 20% now earns more than ten times the income of the poorest 20%.,503,53951,200705
Inequality is not good for the economy – it is wasteful and costly.,503,53951,200705
It is not equality but poverty that drains public resources.,503,53951,200705
It is far better for all of us when everybody can make their full contribution to our economy and society.,503,53951,200705
"When everyone is working and earning a decent income, they are also spending, supporting businesses and paying their fair share of tax to ensure that the Government can provide all the services, social supports and other infrastructure needed to grow and spread prosperity.",503,53951,200705
All parties claim to oppose poverty and support equality.,305,53951,200705
Only Sinn Féin has brought the Equality Agenda to the centre of all our economic and social policy.,305,53951,200705
Equality is at the heart of Sinn Féin’s agenda for government.,503,53951,200705
"We believe in the right to universal access to excellent healthcare, education and childcare.",504,53951,200705
We believe in the constitutional right to a home.,504,53951,200705
We believe in building the economy,410,53951,200705
and using the wealth created for the public good.,504,53951,200705
We believe that people should pay according to their ability to pay,503,53951,200705
"and that everyone should have equal access to the highest quality public services, infrastructure and social protections.",503,53951,200705
For ten years there has been unprecedented revenue available to the Irish Government.,305,53951,200705
They have had the ability and the resources to deal effectively with poverty and inequality.,305,53951,200705
"They have had the resources to deliver an end to the crisis in the health service, to build social and affordable housing, to provide a decent education system and to introduce comprehensive childcare.",305,53951,200705
They have chosen not to.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin would make different choices.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that public finances should be used to share the wealth by ensuring the highest possible quality of infrastructure,411,53951,200705
and public services are available equally to all as of right.,503,53951,200705
"We undertake to guarantee that everyone’s basic needs and rights to food and warmth, housing, health, education and childcare are met",503,53951,200705
and that all have the benefit of a comprehensive regime of social protections.,504,53951,200705
We are committed to eliminate poverty through the progressive achievement of the equitable distribution of the wealth of Ireland amongst the people of Ireland.,503,53951,200705
"These objectives require taxation justice,",503,53951,200705
"a new emphasis on the generation of significant non-tax revenue, and public spending policies that are sustainable, transparent and accountable and that eliminate waste.",303,53951,200705
They will also require the removal of many of the current constraints on our economic sovereignty imposed by the EU.,503,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that poverty must be eradicated.,503,53951,200705
Our society is now in a better position than ever before to achieve this.,503,53951,200705
Yet the current Irish Government has failed to use our economic success to benefit everyone.,305,53951,200705
"It has failed to share the abundant wealth with those most vulnerable such as the unemployed, large families, lone parent families, those in low-income jobs, older people, and people with disabilities.",305,53951,200705
"As a consequence of bad policy choices and wrong priorities, nearly one in five people are still at risk of poverty and struggle to make ends meet.",305,53951,200705
"Almost 275,000 people are still poor enough that they lack some of the necessities of life including adequate food, shelter, warmth and clothing.",305,53951,200705
We have one of the highest rates of child poverty in the EU and OECD.,503,53951,200705
"Over 60,000 people cannot afford to adequately heat their homes.",503,53951,200705
All parties pay lip service to eliminating poverty.,305,53951,200705
Only Sinn Féin brings this commitment into the heart of our economic policy,305,53951,200705
and elevates it as our principal economic objective.,305,53951,200705
Elimination of poverty is a national aspiration shared by virtually every Irish person,601,53951,200705
and we are committed to do what is necessary to achieve this goal.,305,53951,200705
"We believe there is a positive obligation on government to eliminate poverty by providing a comprehensive system of social supports to ensure that everyone has a decent quality of life,",504,53951,200705
"does not lack for essentials,",504,53951,200705
and can access appropriate education and employment.,506,53951,200705
"Social welfare reforms should not be used to force people into low paid employment, creating a larger substratum of ‘working poor’.",504,53951,200705
"We propose to take all necessary steps to genuinely ease the transition from welfare to work through education and employment measures,",408,53951,200705
"accessible and affordable childcare,",504,53951,200705
and appropriate and adequate income supports.,504,53951,200705

increase support for unpaid care,504,53951,200705
work and tackle disability-related poverty.,506,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team was to the fore in highlighting the fact that poverty has left a significant proportion of the population marginalised and excluded.,705,53951,200705
We called the Government to account for it inaction on the National Anti-Poverty Strategy commitments,503,53951,200705
and on child poverty.,503,53951,200705
We repeatedly raised with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs the fact that social welfare payments and pensions are not adequate to keep people out of poverty.,706,53951,200705
We opposed cuts in Community Employment (CE) and J1 schemes.,504,53951,200705
Every year at Budget time we pressed for additional assistance for lone parents who experience disproportionate levels of poverty.,504,53951,200705
We were foremost in pressing for an increase in Child Dependent Allowance when the government maintained a freeze on it.,504,53951,200705
"We continuously raised the issue of fuel poverty,",504,53951,200705
including specifically pushing for additional measures to address the impact of fuel price increases.,504,53951,200705
Since 2004 our Pre-Budget Submissions Putting Children First and Putting Low Income Families First included proposals aimed at ending poverty for those in employment,504,53951,200705
and increasing social protections of those out of work or working in the home.,504,53951,200705
We also put forward specific proposals for helping the less well off cope with rising costs.,504,53951,200705
"Increase the minimum wage to 60% of average industrial earnings, index-linked to inflation.",504,53951,200705
Eliminate the discriminatory lower rate of pay for young people.,504,53951,200705
Set a new longer term benchmark against which the evolution of social welfare rtes can be measured.,504,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is proposing that a new short term target of 35% of gross average industrial earnings be set.,504,53951,200705
Double the Living Alone Allowance.,504,53951,200705
Increase the Family Income Supplement by €68 per week and make it an automatic payment.,504,53951,200705
"Ensure all those eligible take it up, reduce the qualifying working hours",504,53951,200705
and make it more flexible to recognise seasonal work.,504,53951,200705
Extend eligibility for the Back to Work Allowance to include those who are unemployed for more than 12 months.,504,53951,200705
Extend the new Early Childcare Supplement to include children aged 6 to12.,504,53951,200705
Ensure lone parents can keep their rent supplement for at least 3 years of full-time work and,504,53951,200705
continually if they are in part-time employment.,504,53951,200705
"Introduce adequate supports to ensure that lone parents in work can access well-paid and meaningful employment,",504,53951,200705
including a comprehensive revamp of schemes for bringing lone parents back into the formal education system as a crucial element of incentives to return to work.,504,53951,200705
Ensure that proposed reforms replacing the One Parent Family Payment with a Parental Allowance,504,53951,200705
are accompanied by adequate education/training and childcare supports,504,53951,200705
Remove the cut-off point for the new Parental Allowance (proposed when children reach the age of 7).,504,53951,200705
"Increase the weekly fuel allowance payment to €25,",504,53951,200705
"or the equivalent in an allowance for units of electricity and heating fuel,",504,53951,200705
"for those on social welfare payments and families eligible for FIS, and extend the fuel allowance from the beginning of September to the end of",504,53951,200705
April – for 34 weeks instead of the current 29 weeks.,504,53951,200705
Make the Back to Education Allowance available to all those on low incomes after six months unemployment.,504,53951,200705
"Abolish the means test for carers,",504,53951,200705
"substantially increase the Carer’s Allowance, respite care and support services and provide for needs assessment and training of carers.",504,53951,200705
Increase the Orphan Guardian Payment to the level of the Foster Care Allowance.,504,53951,200705
Change the criteria to ensure that grandparents or other family members do not have to agree that the child in question was ‘abandoned’ in order to receive payments to help look after the children of their drug-addicted sons and daughters,504,53951,200705
and bring supports into line with provision for foster parents.,504,53951,200705
"Introduce a Cost of Disability Payment on a phased basis, to offset extra costs related to disability",504,53951,200705
and in recognition of disproportionate rates of poverty and unemployment among people with disabilities.,706,53951,200705
The most important reason for a Government to raise revenue is for the purpose of financing world class public services,504,53951,200705
and infrastructure,504,53951,200705
and social protections from which all benefit or potentially benefit.,504,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that this revenue should be raised fairly:,503,53951,200705
"those who have more should pay more, and those who have less should pay less.",503,53951,200705
No tax should be unfair or onerous.,503,53951,200705
No one should have to pay twice as a consequence of service charges and user fees for what should be public services already paid for through taxation.,503,53951,200705
The Government should also seek to raise revenue through methods other than taxation or selling off public assets in order to reduce the burden on taxpayers to the greatest possible extent.,503,53951,200705
The current system for raising public finance is unjust and needs to change.,503,53951,200705
Successive Government policy has created a situation whereby some of the wealthiest people on this island pay no income tax at all,503,53951,200705
"– while people on middle incomes are not only paying tax at a rate of 41%,",503,53951,200705
they also pay disproportionately more of their income on tax through consumption tax (VAT) as well as on the indirect or double taxes of service charges and user fees.,503,53951,200705
Almost one third of the overall tax take is raised through consumption tax.,0,53951,200705
"When taken together with excise duties, it amounts to nearly half of all tax receipts.",503,53951,200705
The coalition government redistributed wealth in favour of the alreadywealthy.,503,53951,200705
They have allowed the super-rich to skim off the rest of us.,413,53951,200705
They have also sold off public assets and profitable public companies and contracted public services out privately.,413,53951,200705
"This policy has not only deprived the State of important sources of non-tax revenue,",503,53951,200705
it has also subjected people to double taxation.,503,53951,200705
All parties claim to be in favour of fair taxation but none has made it happen.,305,53951,200705
Only Sinn Féin has the will to tackle the super rich,305,53951,200705
– the exploiters who make super profits by the clever use of tax loopholes,305,53951,200705
– and to maximise public ownership of profitable companies.,413,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin is committed to public finance reform and taxation justice, to enhancing non-tax sources of public revenue, and to spending the public wealth responsibly",504,53951,200705
"– on the delivery of services,",504,53951,200705
infrastructure and social protections for the benefit of all.,504,53951,200705
Our basic principle is that people should pay according to their ability to pay.,503,53951,200705
We believe that tax policy should be about reducing the burden on low and middle-income people as much as possible.,503,53951,200705
It should be about encouraging local small businesses and the social economy.,402,53951,200705
"It should be about ensuring there is sufficient revenue to deliver strong public services,",411,53951,200705
Infrastructure,504,53951,200705
and social protections.,504,53951,200705
That is what we would work to see delivered in government.,0,53951,200705
"It is not fair that the lower-paid should subsidise the wealthy, as is currently the case.",503,53951,200705
Everybody should pay their fair share – and no more than that.,503,53951,200705
The tax system needs to be overhauled to bring about a fair and equal system where everybody pays their fair share.,503,53951,200705
Our first order of business for tax policy will be eliminating and closing all the loopholes and reducing the burden on the lowest-paid.,503,53951,200705
We are also committed to reclaim and protect Irish sovereignty over taxation from encroachment by the EU,110,53951,200705
and to harmonise the tax system on an all-Ireland basis.,607,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team was to the fore in highlighting the injustices at the heart of the present tax regime.,503,53951,200705
Each year we made a Pre-Budget Submission to the Minister for Finance setting out what we believe should be Government priorities.,305,53951,200705
We demanded the lowering of the burden on low and middle income earners by reducing,503,53951,200705
"and removing regressive features that penalise them,",503,53951,200705
including ending indirect taxes such as refuse charges that constitute double taxation.,503,53951,200705
"We were foremost in demanding the abolition of damaging, costly and unjust tax giveaways to speculators and developers.",503,53951,200705
We strongly opposed Government use of tax breaks to promote the private healthcare business.,503,53951,200705
"Keep those on or below the minimum wage out of the tax net,",503,53951,200705
and set the minimum wage at a minimum of 60% of average industrial earnings.,503,53951,200705
Keep those on or below the average industrial earnings within the standard rate tax band.,503,53951,200705
Oppose the introduction of user fees and service charges for essential public services and review the existing charges,412,53951,200705
that apply to public services to plan for their reduction and removal.,412,53951,200705
"Conduct a comprehensive review of the VAT system in order to identify the best ways to reduce the consumption tax burden on the lowest paid within present EU constraints,.",503,53951,200705
"Campaign at EU level for repeal of the EU VAT Directive to restore Member State sovereignty on VAT,",110,53951,200705
and determine the most appropriate way to achieve VAT harmonisation on an all-Ireland basis.,601,53951,200705
Aggressively pursue tax evasion,605,53951,200705
and invest adequate resources for tax collection and enforcement.,605,53951,200705
Close all remaining legal loopholes that have allowed millionaires to pay no tax whatsoever.,503,53951,200705
Introduce legislation to end tax exile status – the ability of high income individuals to declare themselves ‘non-resident for tax purposes’.,503,53951,200705
Review all current tax exemptions and retain only those where the economic and social value clearly outweighs the cost of the exemption to the Exchequer (for example in the case of R&D).,503,53951,200705
"Increase restrictions on the use of specified tax reliefs by high-income individuals, for example by introducing a ceiling on exempt income.",503,53951,200705
"Conduct an early, comprehensive review of the tax system to be completed within one year,",503,53951,200705
in order to ensure a just and equitable system where everyone pays their fair share of tax but no more than that.,503,53951,200705
"Work for the restoration of economic sovereignty and for EU Member States to retain complete control over taxation policy and strategy,",110,53951,200705
and in particular work for the restoration of Member State competence in relation to VAT through repeal of the EU VAT Directive.,110,53951,200705
Negotiate for tax harmonisation across the island.,601,53951,200705
We aim to keep public service provision high and taxes as low as possible.,412,53951,200705
This means that finding other non-tax sources of public revenue must become a priority.,413,53951,200705
Sinn Féin would therefore put a unique new policy emphasis on maximising non-tax sources of revenue.,0,53951,200705
Current Government policy is not concerned with this.,305,53951,200705
In 2005 only approximately 1. 5% of overall Government revenue came from non-tax sources.,413,53951,200705
"There is ample but as yet underdeveloped potential to realise significant revenue from profitable public companies, particularly in strategic sectors such as transport, communications and energy.",413,53951,200705
"For example, in 2005 the Exchequer received in excess of €5 million in royalties from Marathon Petroleum,",413,53951,200705
"in excess of €10 million from Bord Gáis Éireann,",413,53951,200705
approximately €73.5 million in dividends from the ESB,413,53951,200705
and it is estimated that the Corrib field may contain reserves valued at up to €21 billion.,413,53951,200705
The experience of Norway where the mineral exploration sector has become one of the engines of economic growth proves the benefits of state involvement in the natural resources sector in particular.,413,53951,200705
Earnings from oil and gas contribute almost one third of state revenue in Norway.,413,53951,200705
"In contrast, the Irish Government has actually surrendered our entire stake in any finds,",305,53951,200705
"reduced tax levels,",305,53951,200705
abolished royalties,413,53951,200705
and granted long-term frontier licences.,413,53951,200705
All this has been done at a great financial loss to the people of Ireland and the Exchequer.,305,53951,200705
We would reverse the irresponsible policies of natural resource giveaway,413,53951,200705
and official neglect of opportunities to raise non-tax revenue by investing in profitable public companies.,413,53951,200705
"Moreover, we would invest strategically in the accelerated development of the renewable energy sector,",416,53951,200705
"as this is the way of the future: moving us towards environmental sustainability,",416,53951,200705
energy independence,416,53951,200705
and enhanced non-tax sources of public revenue.,413,53951,200705
We recognise that current EU rules impose some constraints on our objectives.,110,53951,200705
"We would therefore work with allies in Europe for the necessary reforms at EU level to remove these impediments,",110,53951,200705
and we would also pursue specific exemptions similar to those achieved by Germany to allow Ireland to use State aid to finance reunification.,601,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team published a motion advocating the creation of a public company to oversee mineral explorations,413,53951,200705
and the imposition of proper tax and royalties.,413,53951,200705
We raised these demands with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources on numerous occasions.,305,53951,200705
"We made a comprehensive submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport opposing the proposed privatisation of Aer Lingus,",413,53951,200705
"wrote to the EU Commissioner urging an investigation of the attempted takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair,",413,53951,200705
"repeatedly raised the airline privatisation issue with the Minister for Transport,",413,53951,200705
"and moved a Dáil motion opposing the proposed sale of Aer Lingus,/ prompting a debate in the House.",413,53951,200705
Throughout this campaign we were in regular contact with SIPTU union leaders,701,53951,200705
and raised airline employee concerns regularly in the Dáil.,701,53951,200705
Reform the current exploration licensing and taxation regime and renegotiate oil and gas contracts.,413,53951,200705
"Establish a State oil, gas and mineral exploration company that would actively participate and invest in exploration",413,53951,200705
"which, alongside a proper revenue and royalties structure,",413,53951,200705
would ensure that such finds benefit the Irish people by providing additional revenue for the Exchequer.,413,53951,200705
Plan for strategic public investment in developing the renewable energy sector,416,53951,200705
including the establishment of a profitable company or companies in public ownership.,413,53951,200705
Set a target for becoming a net exporter of electricity from renewable sources.,416,53951,200705
Keep the ESB and all other profitable public companies in public ownership.,413,53951,200705
Actively pursue returning Eircom and Aer Lingus to public ownership.,413,53951,200705
Explore and pursue the possibilities for the establishment of new public sector companies.,413,53951,200705
"Negotiate at EU level for an exception to the EU State Aid Rules similar to that conceded to Germany,",110,53951,200705
to assist post-partition reconstruction for reunification.,601,53951,200705
"The big question for many people is whether the vast amount of revenues, generated from both the EU and taxation, are being put to the most efficient use.",305,53951,200705
The answer to that question is No.,0,53951,200705
Official incompetence and corruption have resulted in waste of public resources,304,53951,200705
and failure to meet budget and completion targets.,305,53951,200705
"We all know about the faulty electronic voting machines,",305,53951,200705
"the PPARS health computer system which does not work,",305,53951,200705
the overruns in the Port Tunnel and other major road and infrastructure projects.,305,53951,200705
There has been some improvement in relation to spending on major road projects in recent months but the overall problem remains.,305,53951,200705
The era of government squandering public finances has to end.,305,53951,200705
"All parties claim a monopoly on fiscal responsibility,",305,53951,200705
but what we need are credible proposals to deal with the problem.,305,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin is determined to change the bad planning and procurement policies,",305,53951,200705
the poor decision making and established practices,305,53951,200705
"– and to challenge the vested interests, privatisation and lack of public accountability –",303,53951,200705
that have resulted in cost overruns and wastage.,303,53951,200705
We are equally determined to introduce new policies and practices that ensure responsible spending of the public wealth in the public interest.,303,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin believes that publicly-funded projects must deliver on budget and on time,",303,53951,200705
and we would take the necessary steps to guarantee value for public money.,303,53951,200705
We propose to introduce efficiency and effectiveness audits to ensure that public spending is meeting economic and social goals.,303,53951,200705
We propose to end the wasting of public funds on Public-Private-Partnerships which are inefficient and ineffective.,413,53951,200705
We propose to introduce significant efficiencies in investment and spending through all-Ireland procurement.,601,53951,200705
And we propose to introduce more direct accountability for public spending and participation in public spending decisions through mechanisms,202,53951,200705
including the establishment of an All-Ireland Consultative Civic Forum.,202,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team consistently drew attention to the extent to which public money is wasted through PPPs.,413,53951,200705
We used our annual Pre-Budget Submissions to call for equalityproofing and poverty-proofing of the Budget.,503,53951,200705
Subject public spending not just to ‘value for money’ efficiency audits but also to regular effectiveness audits against social and economic goals.,303,53951,200705
"Empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine all existing PPP projects for cost overruns,",303,53951,200705
revenue foregone and wastage against long-term cost and profit projections.,303,53951,200705
End the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPP),413,53951,200705
and reassess existing PPP contracts with a view to returning them to the public sector.,413,53951,200705
"Immediately implement public investment as a new area of all-Ireland co-operation,",601,53951,200705
"operating as a formal partnership between the Strategic Investment Board in the 6 Counties and the National Development Finance Agency in the 26 Counties, with a remit to include coordination of State and local procurement strategies as well as public and social investment.",601,53951,200705
"Establish an All-Ireland Procurement and Purchasing Agency accountable to the Dáil, Assembly and All-Ireland Ministerial Council to introduce greater efficiencies.",303,53951,200705
Establish a mechanism for participatory budgeting through the All-Ireland Consultative Civic Forum to increase accountability and to allow taxpayers and other voters to have direct input into budgetary priorities.,303,53951,200705
Practice multi-annual budgeting and ring-fence a meaningful proportion for programmes,303,53951,200705
aimed at reversing economic inequality and eliminating poverty.,503,53951,200705
"Establish an All-Ireland Comptroller and Auditor General’s Office accountable to the Dáil, Assembly and All-Ireland Ministerial Council sited in the AIMC Directorate.",303,53951,200705
Sinn Féin wants to see a new deal for rural Ireland.,703,53951,200705
We want to ensure that people can continue to live and work and count on a decent quality of life in rural communities.,703,53951,200705
We want to see agriculture and fisheries remain an important part of our rural and coastal economies.,703,53951,200705
We want to see the development of new and potentially dynamic sectors of the rural and coastal economies such as renewable energy production.,416,53951,200705
"Successive Governments, led by all the establishment parties have presided over the economic and demographic decline of rural Ireland.",305,53951,200705
This decline is neither inevitable nor accidental but the result of decades of neglect and wrong policy,305,53951,200705
"– the failure to act as a strong advocate for Irish farming, Irish fishing and rural communities as a whole.",305,53951,200705
"It is also the result of a discriminatory approach to investment in off-farm employment, infrastructure and service provision.",305,53951,200705
"We strongly believe that with equal treatment, planning, innovation, investment and other support,",503,53951,200705
"rural and coastal economies, industries, businesses and communities can have a sustainable future.",0,53951,200705
"Moreover, we are convinced that future viability – particularly of Irish farming, fishing and new rural industries – rests on their development within an all-Ireland context.",703,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is the only party fully committed to this.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin wants to empower rural communities to reach their maximum potential.,703,53951,200705
"We want to create strong and sustainable rural communities supported by sustainable rural economies,",703,53951,200705
"adequate infrastructure,",411,53951,200705
and equal access to housing and public services.,504,53951,200705
We believe that the means to achieving rural regeneration is through all-Ireland investment and planning underpinned by a commitment to Rural Equality.,703,53951,200705
Rural Equality requires in the first instance real decentralisation for balanced regional development.,301,53951,200705
This means more than the decentralisation of government departments:,301,53951,200705
it means decentralisation of investment and the incentives that create employment opportunities.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin will guarantee an equal level of provision of essential public services for all.,503,53951,200705
We will redress the current infrastructural deficits by extending rural transport and broadband networks.,401,53951,200705
We will ensure the safety of people living in rural communities by providing adequate levels of policing.,605,53951,200705
We will address the planning permission problem that is creating a crisis in rural housing and reducing the overall viability of rural communities.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin proposes a strategic programme for affirmative action in all these areas to redress the unequal treatment of rural communities to date.,301,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team regularly raised the effects of overall Government policies on the quality of life in rural communities.,703,53951,200705
"We argued for equality for rural hospitals and schools, transport and communications.",503,53951,200705
"We argued against closures of rural post offices, cutbacks in rural policing,",305,53951,200705
and the planning restrictions that impede local people from accessing housing.,305,53951,200705
We published a Private Members motion on rural regeneration which triggered the most wide-ranging debate on the issue in the lifetime of the current Dáil.,0,53951,200705
Immediately commission an All-Ireland Rural White Paper that will take into account the needs of all those living and working in rural areas.,703,53951,200705
"Agree a comprehensive, fully integrated, properly resourced All-Ireland Rural Regeneration Strategy –",301,53951,200705
"in consultation with farmers and fishermen, rural businesses, rural communities and their representative organisations.",703,53951,200705
Introduce a package of incentives to create rural economic hubs.,402,53951,200705

Establish a Rural Health Taskforce.,504,53951,200705

Provide universal access to broadband services on an all-Ireland basis.,411,53951,200705
Ensure PEACE III funding specifically targets social need in the border corridor.,411,53951,200705
Agriculture remains an important part of rural life,703,53951,200705
and a key economic factor even for those not directly employed on farms.,703,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is committed to ensure that family farming is protected from further erosion.,703,53951,200705
"Moreover, we are committed to achieve the revitalisation of Irish agriculture into the future.",703,53951,200705
An ever-increasing share of the price charged to consumers now goes to processors and retail conglomerates.,703,53951,200705
This is making it difficult for farmers to remain economically viable:,703,53951,200705
"indeed, little more than half of dairy and tillage farmers and only 15% of beef farmers can achieve this.",703,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin supported the introduction of the Single Farm Payment as part of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),",703,53951,200705
as it provides a potential means to allow family farms to increase their income and viability.,703,53951,200705
The Government failed to capitalise on this.,305,53951,200705
It has also failed to frame a strategy that would boost agricultural incomes through a focus on development of new sectors and food processing for higher value production.,703,53951,200705
The Government has accepted diktats from the EU even where these have proved disastrous for Irish farmers.,110,53951,200705
"A prime example of this was its refusal to defend the Irish sugar industry,",406,53951,200705
which was sacrificed in an EU deal with the WTO and then asset-stripped by Greencore shareholders.,110,53951,200705
"It also did not oppose EU moves towards the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops, which would be disastrous for the Irish tillage sector.",305,53951,200705
Nor did it defend the Irish beef sector from the threat posed by meat imports from third countries.,406,53951,200705
Sinn Féin will act as strong advocates for Irish farmers,703,53951,200705
and proactively plan to ensure a viable and sustainable future for Irish agriculture.,703,53951,200705
We have demonstrated the depth of our commitment by selecting the Agriculture Ministry in the northern Assembly over other competing priorities.,703,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes the reformed CAP will only benefit farmers if the Irish Government forms its own strategy to support the future of farming.,703,53951,200705
Such a strategy must be all-Ireland in scope.,601,53951,200705
It must focus on new areas of production including renewable energy crops,416,53951,200705
"and organic farming, as well as higher value processing of Irish food products in Ireland.",416,53951,200705
"It must also ensure the protection of food produce from the threats posed by cheap imports,",406,53951,200705
further EU and World Trade Organisation (WTO) restrictions and the possible introduction of GM crops.,416,53951,200705
Sinn Féin proposes to market Irish produce as ‘safe food’.,406,53951,200705
"We will therefore introduce the stringent labelling of all food products on an all-Ireland basis, to support the buying of Irish food produce both for economic and health and safety reasons.",416,53951,200705
This is in the interests of producers as well as consumers.,416,53951,200705
"We will support the extension of organic farming, which currently constitutes a very small part of overall production despite the clear demand for such produce and higher-than-average incomes earned by organic farmers catering for either the domestic or export market.",416,53951,200705
"We also propose a series of measures to secure fair payment for farmers including support for the formation of farmers’ co-operatives for domestic production, processing and retailing,",703,53951,200705
and the extension of farmers markets to circumvent the grip of the large processors and retailers that squeeze producers’ incomes.,703,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team consistently defended the interests of the family farm in contributions to debates on legislation and in hundreds of questions to the Minister for Agriculture.,703,53951,200705
We argued for a fairer price for farmers and promoted the advantages of reviving genuine farmers cooperatives to challenge the power of agri-business.,703,53951,200705
"We stood up for the rights of farmers on the Early Retirement Scheme (ERS), championed the rights of those farmers who lost out with the introduction of the Single Farm Payment, argued for fairer treatment for those who entered into the ERS in good faith,",703,53951,200705
and challenged the claim that their fate was out of the Government’s hands due to EU directives.,110,53951,200705
We continually questioned this Government’s support for GM at EU level and its implications for Irish agriculture.,305,53951,200705
"We strongly argued against closure of the Irish sugar industry, condemning the massive compensation awarded to Greencore in contrast to the fund available to the 3,600 growers and the paltry redundancy settlement for former sugar factory employees.",701,53951,200705
"We put the case for the growing of energy crops as a profitable alternative production system, and published detailed proposals on the use of sugar beet as an input into the production of bio-ethanol.",416,53951,200705
We argued for the promotion of energy crops as a source of increased farm incomes,416,53951,200705
and future jobs in the agricultural processing sector.,703,53951,200705
"Ensure that the maximum number of people continue farming, while stemming the shift towards large-scale factory-style farming.",703,53951,200705
Fully implement the Charter for Farmers on an all-Ireland basis.,703,53951,200705
"Integrate agri-food and agricultural services on an all-Ireland basis, including an All-Ireland Food Promotion Agency.",703,53951,200705
Ring-fence the milk quota within the island of Ireland to ensure that quota from the Six Counties is not sold into the British quota.,703,53951,200705
We also support regional ring fencing.,301,53951,200705
Develop an island-wide animal health strategy.,501,53951,200705
Oppose importation of cheap meat that fails to meet the strict food safety regulations imposed here.,406,53951,200705
Establish an all-Ireland CAP Reform Review Group to conduct bi-annual reviews for anomalies and unfair outcomes.,406,53951,200705
Work towards single representation of Ireland in trade talks to allow stronger future negotiations at EU and WTO level.,406,53951,200705
Work to amend the Single Farm Payment regulations to raise the lower income limit,703,53951,200705
"and impose a higher income limit, in order to redirect EU funds and ensure a decent livelihood for smaller farmers.",703,53951,200705
Actively promote domestic co-operative processing and the development of local markets.,301,53951,200705
Assist farm diversification into new areas such as organic farming,416,53951,200705
and renewable energy.,416,53951,200705

Invest in renewable energy,416,53951,200705
Encourage co-op-led processing.,416,53951,200705
Facilitate the conversion of the Carlow and Mallow sugar plants to biofuel production.,416,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is committed to doing all that we can to secure a viable future for coastal communities and economies.,501,53951,200705
Ireland’s fisheries have been scandalously sacrificed since EU accession in 1973.,501,53951,200705
The deal made under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) handed over control of the national fisheries to EU bureaucrats,110,53951,200705
and squandered a potentially massively valuable resource in exchange for what was believed to be a good deal for farming within the Common Agricultural Policy.,305,53951,200705
"Ironically, the value of fish taken from Irish waters by foreign fleets since 1973 – over €40 billion in current values – has actually exceeded the total sum of CAP monies received.",110,53951,200705
"The division of quotas has also led to a situation where this country has fishing waters that account for around 12% of the EU fishery, but Irish fishermen are currently allowed only around 4% of the EU quota.",110,53951,200705
"Not only have successive Governments led by all the establishment parties acquiesced in this,",305,53951,200705
they have also failed to encourage the development of indigenous processing to its full potential.,305,53951,200705
"Thus the greater part of fish caught in Irish waters even by Irish fishermen is exported raw,",703,53951,200705
and much of that value is lost to the domestic processing sector and to struggling coastal communities.,703,53951,200705
The current Government has continued to neglect the fishing industry and has at times adopted a confrontational attitude towards fishermen.,305,53951,200705
"They attempted to force through the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, which would introduce draconian measures to penalise Irish fishermen at a time when the sector is struggling to survive.",305,53951,200705
The future of the Irish fisheries is nowhere on the establishment parties’ political agenda.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin proposes to end the neglect of this economy and the communities it supports.,305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that strong Government action is needed to empower coastal communities,301,53951,200705
and secure a sustainable future for the Irish fisheries.,416,53951,200705
"We propose to establish a dedicated Ministry for this purpose,",703,53951,200705
"to lobby and negotiate within the EU for radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy,",601,53951,200705
to establish all-Ireland management and to adopt an all-Ireland strategic plan.,703,53951,200705
We propose to involve fishing organisations directly in the conservation and management of the Irish fisheries.,703,53951,200705
"We will establish a hardship fund to fairly compensate those forced out of the fishing industry, and we will invest in and otherwise encourage development of the domestic seafood processing and renewable energy sectors to create new coastal employment.",703,53951,200705
"To commence the coastal revitalisation process, Sinn Féin would use the EU Green Paper on the Future of the Common Fisheries Policy as the basis for a wide-ranging debate in the country regarding the future of the fishing sector,",703,53951,200705
ensuring the fullest involvement of all fishing organisations,703,53951,200705
and coastal community organisations and elected representatives from those communities.,703,53951,200705
"Our Dáil Team opposed the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, tabling numerous amendments in close consultation with the main fishing organisations.",305,53951,200705
"We were instrumental in forcing a debate that prompted a major reversal on the part of the Irish Government, if not to the full satisfaction of the demands of fishermen.",305,53951,200705
We successfully lobbied the Department to meet with fishing representatives,305,53951,200705
and provide for closer consultation with the fishing organisations in the regulation of the sector.,305,53951,200705
We supported the joint efforts of fishing organisations operating in the Irish Sea in relation to the management of that fishery.,305,53951,200705
"We raised a number of issues with the Minister including the unfavourable treatment of Irish fishermen in regard to quotas,",703,53951,200705
"irregularities relating to the issuing of quotas, and failure to confront illegal fishing by foreign crews, in contrast to the heavy-handed treatment of Irish boats.",703,53951,200705
We argued with the Minister that the Common Fisheries Policy has been a disaster for Irish fishing and needs to be completely overhauled.,305,53951,200705
We participated in a delegation of Sinn Féin representatives that brought these and other concerns directly to officials of the EU Fisheries Directorate.,305,53951,200705
Establish a separate Ministry for the Marine and Natural Resources with a full Minister.,703,53951,200705
Negotiate radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy with the aim of returning the greater part of  management of  Irish fisheries back into Irish hands.,703,53951,200705
Propose the establishment of a Coastal Communities Regeneration Fund under the CFP similar to that under CAP.,703,53951,200705
Establish fisheries as a new area of all-Ireland co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement,601,53951,200705
and develop an All-Ireland Strategy to Safeguard the Future of the Irish Fisheries.,703,53951,200705
Directly involve the fishing organisations in the management of Irish fisheries.,703,53951,200705
"Introduce a transparent system of issuing of licences, quota and tonnage.",703,53951,200705
Conduct a thorough investigation of past decisions in this regard by the Department of the Marine.,703,53951,200705
Conserve Irish fish stocks by reducing the quota available to foreign fleets,703,53951,200705
and introduce proper independent scientific monitoring of stocks in direct consultation with fishermen.,703,53951,200705
End all illegal fishing conducted in Irish waters,703,53951,200705
under the guise of EU research.,110,53951,200705
"Enhance the potential of the Irish marine sector by supporting the further development of a domestic seafood processing industry,",416,53951,200705
and by adopting an all-Ireland marketing strategy for Irish seafood.,416,53951,200705
Invest in the accelerated development of wind and wave energyproduction.,416,53951,200705
Ensure adequate compensation for Driftnet Salmon Fishermen.,703,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that every person has the equal right to safety at home and in our communities.,503,53951,200705
"Everyone also has the right to a fully accountable policing service,",503,53951,200705
"imbued with a human rights ethos,",201,53951,200705
and to a justice system in which they can have confidence.,605,53951,200705
Yet the working class communities hit hardest by certain kinds of crime lack the levels and modes of policing and other services that would deter crime and other anti-social behaviour.,605,53951,200705
Many have lost faith in the policing and justice system.,0,53951,200705
The current coalition’s record on justice and community safety has been woeful.,305,53951,200705
They introduced gimmicky Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs),305,53951,200705
and the Garda Reserve to cover their refusal to concentrate policing resources where they are needed most.,305,53951,200705
The Justice Minister is more interested in getting private developers to build an unnecessary super-prison than in ensuring that the Probation Service has adequate resources.,305,53951,200705
He has ignored the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General which concluded that community service orders have a more positive impact on rates of re-offending than prison and cost about one-third of custodial sentence.,305,53951,200705
Domestic violence and sexual abuse are pervasive crimes they have never strategically or comprehensively addressed in crime policy.,305,53951,200705
Instead they starved frontline victims’ services of funding.,305,53951,200705
"The system is failing these people: the number of these cases coming before the courts in this State is the lowest among 20 European countries, and we have a conviction rate of just 5%.",305,53951,200705
The current Government refuses to acknowledge,305,53951,200705
the true extent of Garda corruption and the culture of cover-up that prevails in the force.,304,53951,200705
They failed to act in a meaningful way on the findings and recommendations of the five Morris Tribunal reports.,305,53951,200705
Successive Irish Governments presided over by all the establishment parties have failed to make communities safe,305,53951,200705
or produce a coherent and robust approach to prevent crime before it happens.,305,53951,200705
All parties claim to be tough on crime.,305,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin has the only credible plan for crime prevention, community safety and fully accountable policing.",305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that the most effective crime policies focus on prevention.,305,53951,200705
This means intensive and systematic social investment in marginalised areas.,504,53951,200705
It means providing intervention and support services for individuals and families at risk.,504,53951,200705
It means accountable community policing.,504,53951,200705
"It means effective rehabilitation programmes for prisoners and other offenders,",504,53951,200705
and comprehensive post-release community supervision.,0,53951,200705
We are committed to deliver these as a matter of priority.,0,53951,200705
"We believe that for most non-violent offences, community restorative justice alternatives can be more effective than custody, for both victim and offender.",0,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin justice policy will be more effective socially,",503,53951,200705
and it also makes better economic sense – reducing both the incidence of crime and the high cost of incarceration.,504,53951,200705
"We want real justice for victims, stronger action on domestic and sexual violence,",605,53951,200705
an effective approach to anti-social behavior,606,53951,200705
and effective sentencing reform.,403,53951,200705
We will also regulate the legal profession and increase access to legal representation.,403,53951,200705
We are working towards the establishment of an all-Ireland policing service.,601,53951,200705

We tabled 90 amendments proposing more effective ways of tackling serious crime.,305,53951,200705
We successfully amended the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 to ensure that the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee includes human rights expertise.,201,53951,200705

Establish a new Implementation Body on Justice and Policing under the Good Friday Agreement.,101,53951,200705
Equality and human rights laws and new institutions provided for under the Good Friday Agreement are important advances,201,53951,200705
but social inequality and discrimination still remain a fact of life in Ireland.,503,53951,200705
"Hate crime is on the rise, targeting people on the basis of religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or disability.",503,53951,200705

Older people are still vulnerable to neglect.,706,53951,200705
"Domestic and sexual violence against women is still prevalent,",706,53951,200705
and women continue to be underrepresented in decision-making.,706,53951,200705
People with disabilities are routinely excluded from buildings and services and from economic and social life.,706,53951,200705
Same-sex couples experience discrimination.,705,53951,200705
Successive Governments led by all the establishment parties have failed to effectively address these issues.,705,53951,200705
The Irish Government is no friend to equality and indeed has gone on the offensive against it.,305,53951,200705
This coalition criminalised the Travellers’way of life.,503,53951,200705
They actively scapegoated immigrants and refugees,705,53951,200705
for Government failures in service delivery.,705,53951,200705
They stripped away the equal right of all Irish children to citizenship.,503,53951,200705
They refused to guarantee the rights of people with disabilities in law.,705,53951,200705
They starved organisations helping victims of violence against women of the funding they need to function.,705,53951,200705
"Not surprisingly, therefore, the Minister responsible was reappointed despite his stated view that inequality is good for society.",705,53951,200705
Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement the Irish Government is obliged to introduce equality and human rights protections at least equivalent to those pertaining to the 6 Counties.,201,53951,200705
Yet they have failed to meet the equivalence test on anti-discrimination,201,53951,200705
"and equality protections in a number of areas including disability rights,",503,53951,200705
"the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people,",705,53951,200705
"political opinion,",705,53951,200705
rights enforcement and,705,53951,200705
remedies for discrimination and other violations.,705,53951,200705
Promoting equality and human rights is at the very core of republicanism and of Sinn Féin’s agenda for change.,201,53951,200705
"Unique among the parties on this island, we are not rhetorical on this issue – we bring equality and human rights considerations into every area of our policy.",503,53951,200705
"Our negotiators fought hard for the equality and human rights protections introduced as a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement,",503,53951,200705
and Sinn Féin will continue to press for the,305,53951,200705
fulfilment of the principle of equivalence in human rights and equality protections between the 6 and 26 Counties.,201,53951,200705
Equality is good for the economy and society.,503,53951,200705
We believe that all human rights – including economic and social rights – can and must be enforceable.,503,53951,200705
We strongly believe that human rights begin at home.,201,53951,200705
"All violations past and present must be acknowledged stopped, and robust mechanisms put into place so they can never be repeated.",503,53951,200705

We will campaign for the introduction of an enforceable All-Ireland Charter of Rights as promised under the Good Friday Agreement.,201,53951,200705
"We will campaign in the interim for a range of changes to the 1937 Constitution,",201,53951,200705
"and to incorporate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights into domestic law,",201,53951,200705
so that these rights can be upheld directly through the Irish courts.,201,53951,200705
Our plan for full rights enforceability involves administrative tribunal structures as well as courts.,303,53951,200705
This means that people should not have to go all the way to court to vindicate their rights.,303,53951,200705
Administrative Tribunals and Ombudsman structures make it faster and cheaper to get rights enforced and aim for negotiated settlements.,201,53951,200705
Court challenges then become a true measure of last resort.,303,53951,200705
"In addition, real political will to deliver equality and human rights will also ultimately reduce the number of people needing to sue for their rights.",503,53951,200705
"Our Dáil Team vigorously challenged each and every attack on equality and human rights by the Minister for Justice,",305,53951,200705
by working together with campaigning groups and by proposing legislative amendments to protect and extend equality,503,53951,200705
and human rights protections.,201,53951,200705
"We proposed the introduction of binding human rights-proofing, requiring the Human Rights Commission to certify all legislative proposals as compliant with international human rights standards.",305,53951,200705

Sinn Féin is committed to sustainable development,416,53951,200705

to failure to meet the Kyoto targets or to implement EU environmental directives.,305,53951,200705

Irish is the first official language of this State and the original language of the Irish people.,502,53951,200705
"According to the 2006 Census more than four in ten residents of the 26 Counties speak Irish – a total exceeding 1.6 million people, and a 7% rise on the 2002 Census.",0,53951,200705
"In the Gaeltacht more than one quarter of all people use the Irish language on a daily basis, and more than half of all Gaeltacht children aged 3-4 use Irish daily.",0,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin recognises that language rights are fundamental human rights,",201,53951,200705
and we are committed to ensure that the rights of Irish speakers are respected fully by the Irish Government and all its agencies.,201,53951,200705
Promoting the Irish language is a basic duty of the Irish Government.,502,53951,200705

"More than any other party on the island, Sinn Féin has championed the Irish language.",305,53951,200705
"Whereas other parties in this State have either neglected the language or proposed to eradicate Irish from our school curriculum,",305,53951,200705
Sinn Féin has kept language rights high on our agenda.,502,53951,200705
We have acted as a catalyst for Irish language campaigns in both parts of the island,502,53951,200705
and featured the issue of language rights prominently in all our negotiations with the Irish and British Governments.,502,53951,200705

We believe that everyone on the island of Ireland has a right to learn Irish and have their children educated through Irish medium education.,502,53951,200705
We are also committed to implement all the specific provisions and protections for Irish speakers demanded by international human rights standards.,201,53951,200705
Sinn Féín is working for the development of the Gaeltacht.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin cumainn are active in every Gaeltacht area and the party now has representation in Údarás na Gaeltachta.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin in Government will take strategic initiatives to strengthen the Gaeltachtaí,301,53951,200705
and recognise other areas where 10-30% of the population speak Irish on a daily basis as Breac-Ghaeltachtaí.,301,53951,200705
Sinn Féin welcomes whole-heartedly the emergence of new communities from a variety of ethnic backgrounds in Ireland.,607,53951,200705
"In Government, it is our aim to create a multicultural and multilingual society at every level.",607,53951,200705

We actively campaigned for the safeguarding of Irish in the school curriculum.,502,53951,200705
We defended the protected position of Irish in UCG within the University College Bill 2006.,502,53951,200705

and to help foster demand for Irish language services in other areas.,301,53951,200705
Arts and culture generally enhance our quality of life.,502,53951,200705
Community arts in particular promote development and social inclusion and foster local identity.,502,53951,200705
"They also have the capacity to significantly enhance our economy,",502,53951,200705
driving local economic regeneration and the tourism sector in particular.,502,53951,200705
Sinn Féin believes that arts investment must reflect its true social and economic value.,502,53951,200705
There is an urgent need to end the funding deficit and restructure the arts budget.,502,53951,200705
Sinn Féin is committed to this.,0,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin believes that arts and culture are essential, not an optional extra.",502,53951,200705
"State support for the cultural industrial sector can act as an important investment in both cultural and economic development,",502,53951,200705
particularly in economically peripheral regions.,502,53951,200705
"We specifically recognise that there is significant and growing employment potential in the Irish film industry,",502,53951,200705
which deserves greater support.,502,53951,200705
Sinn Féin will stop the cuts to the arts budget,502,53951,200705
and will restore arts funding to the levels recommended by the Arts Plan.,502,53951,200705
Restoration and a compensatory increase of monies to non-profit and community-based arts groups and projects would be our priority.,502,53951,200705
"As with other areas of the budget, we believe that the only responsible way to prevent further destabilisation of the arts sector is through multi-annual funding and we would commit to this.",502,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team achieved enhanced support for the Irish film industry through securing the renewal of Section 481.,502,53951,200705
We advocated a greater role for local authorities in promoting and funding community arts during debate on the Arts Act 2003.,301,53951,200705
We campaigned in the Dáil for greater protection of national monuments and heritage including the Hill of Tara.,502,53951,200705
"We supported the rights of cultural workers, including the right to form and join trade unions.",701,53951,200705
"During debate on the Film Board Bill 2006 Sinn Féin called on the Irish Government to ensure that the rights of all workers in the industry are fully protected and called for the Labour Inspector to review the conditions of all those working, and particularly younger workers, in the area of media production.",701,53951,200705
"Restore funding to the levels recommended by the Arts Plan, reach a minimum investment target of 1% total budgetary spend.",502,53951,200705
"Devote significant support to co-operatively-run and community arts projects including community festivals,",502,53951,200705
and particularly those that actively promote social inclusion and oppose racism and other forms of discrimination.,503,53951,200705
"Ensure that funding allocation is not discriminatory but fully inclusive, actively and equally promoting not only Irish culture including Irish language arts,",502,53951,200705
but also participation by new communities,705,53951,200705
and a comprehensive disability arts programme.,607,53951,200705
"Make arts and culture a new area of formal all-Ireland co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement,",502,53951,200705
and actively promote the State as a cultural visitor destination within an all-Ireland framework.,502,53951,200705
Demilitarisation and solidarity are the means by which we will achieve a better world.,106,53951,200705
Sinn Féin strongly supports these objectives,305,53951,200705
– shared by the vast majority of Irish people – but they have been steadily undermined by the actions and inactions of successive Irish Governments.,305,53951,200705
Irish military neutrality is under increasing pressure.,105,53951,200705
An EU Army is steadily evolving with the establishment of EU Battle Groups,110,53951,200705
and ever greater EU military research and development budgets.,110,53951,200705
The current coalition have accelerated this process by consistently violating or otherwise undermining their own stated policy of neutrality.,305,53951,200705
"First they joined NATO’s so-called Partnership for Peace without consulting the people,",105,53951,200705
despite an earlier commitment to a referendum.,305,53951,200705
Then they allowed Shannon Airport to be used to facilitate the illegal invasion of Iraq and the illegal programme of secret abduction and torture of prisoners (so-called ‘extraordinary rendition’).,105,53951,200705
Then they failed to negotiate recognition for Irish neutrality during talks on the draft EU Constitution.,110,53951,200705
"Finally, they rushed through the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006 eliminating the triple-lock safeguard on Irish military deployments",105,53951,200705
and enabling the integration of Irish Defence Forces into EU Battle Groups.,110,53951,200705
The cumulative effect of these decisions has been to heighten Irish complicity in human rights violations and compromise neutrality to an unprecedented extent.,105,53951,200705
"Despite the genuine commitment of the Irish people to help Make Poverty History, the UN Millennium Development Goals on global poverty reduction by 2015 have not been a central objective of the current Irish Government.",305,53951,200705
"Instead, they reneged on promises to allocate 0.7% GNP in Overseas Development Assistance by 2007.",305,53951,200705
"This is the third wealthiest state in the world - their decision to reduce our commitment to just 0.5% by 2007 is unjustifiable, and constitutes a betrayal of the world’s poorest.",107,53951,200705
All the political parties claim to support Irish neutrality and the UN and to oppose global poverty and injustice.,305,53951,200705
However only Sinn Féin makes these core guiding principles of our international relations policy.,305,53951,200705
"Sinn Féin believes that true international security is universal and based on social justice,",107,53951,200705
"fully meeting human needs,",201,53951,200705
and respecting human rights and human equality.,201,53951,200705
We propose an independent and progressive Irish international relations policy that opposes military alliances,105,53951,200705
and works for international cooperation and conflict negotiation leading to democratic social change,107,53951,200705
"and respect for human rights, universal demilitarisation and nuclear disarmament.",201,53951,200705
"We support full foreign policy independence,",107,53951,200705
underpinned by support for UN primacy and complemented by a policy of Positive Neutrality in Action.,107,53951,200705
Positive Neutrality in Action is not about sitting on the fence.,107,53951,200705
It is about making politics work to redress legitimate grievances and achieve needed social changes – at both state and international levels.,107,53951,200705
We propose to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.,203,53951,200705
"We recognise the urgent need to reform the UN to build its capacity, and to transform the Security Council by eliminating the system of permanent members with vetoes.",107,53951,200705
"It is not acceptable for this State, acting through the EU, to continue imposing a free trade agenda that hurts the developing world.",305,53951,200705
Instead the Irish Government should focus on ensuring that we do not contribute directly or indirectly to human rights violations in other parts of the world,201,53951,200705
and should use whatever leverage we have to ensure human rights compliance.,201,53951,200705
To work towards global social justice we would push for reform of the international financial system to strengthen representation of developing countries in international economic decision making.,107,53951,200705
"We would campaign for fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals, and increase Irish Official Development Aid accordingly.",107,53951,200705
Our Dáil Team strongly supported the anti-war movement and the Shannon Peace Camp.,105,53951,200705
We were the first party to table a Dáil motion to get US troops out of Shannon.,105,53951,200705
We proposed a Constitutional Amendment Bill to protect neutrality.,107,53951,200705
We consistently challenged the acceleration of militarisation of the EU and its emergence as an economic and military superpower.,110,53951,200705
"We opposed the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006, tabling almost 20 amendments in an effort to save the triple-lock mechanism and neutrality.",107,53951,200705
"We submitted a Book of Evidence on Extraordinary Renditions to Garda Headquarters, demanding an investigation into the CIA’s use of Shannon Airport.",107,53951,200705
"We sought guarantees from the Irish Government that arms in transit to belligerent regimes not be permitted through Irish airports or airspace, and that it would cease delivering military training to soldiers from countries engaging in human rights abuses and breaches of international law.",107,53951,200705
We consistently raised and supported the causes of peoples currently denied the right to self-determination.,107,53951,200705
"For example, we put two motions to the Oireachtas EU Affairs Committee calling for the suspension of preferential trade with Israel on foot of that regime’s illegal occupation of Palestine and grave human rights abuses against the Palestinian and Lebanese people.",107,53951,200705
"We campaigned for incremental increases in Official Development Aid to 0.7% by 2007, and proposed a legislative amendment to ring-fence such aid.",107,53951,200705
We pushed for and secured Oireachtas EU Affairs Committee hearings on the social dimension of the EU’s Lisbon Agenda concerning workers’ rights and anti-poverty issues.,107,53951,200705
Enshrine neutrality in the Constitution and codify it in legislation.,107,53951,200705
"Ensure Irish troops train and serve abroad only under the auspices and leadership of the United Nations, and only with prior Dáil approval.",107,53951,200705
"Prohibit use of Irish airports, airspace, seaports, or territorial waters for preparation for war or other armed conflict by foreign powers or to facilitate any aspect of illegal acts such as the US Government’s programme of ‘extraordinary rendition’.",103,53951,200705
"End Irish involvement in the arms trade and profit from war, including the use of Irish airports to transport arms to belligerent regimes.",103,53951,200705
"Withdraw from the EU Rapid Reaction Force,",110,53951,200705
Battle Groups and NATO’s Partnership for Peace.,105,53951,200705
End Irish complicity in violations of international law and human rights abuses through mainstreamed human rights-proofing of all policy making and decision making at every level.,201,53951,200705
Work for a binding Protocol excluding Ireland from the processes of EU militarisation.,110,53951,200705
"Actively promote demilitarisation of the EU, including nuclear disarmament.",105,53951,200705
"Form alliances with other progressive, neutral states to promote aHuman Security approach to international relations.",105,53951,200705
"Actively promote UN primacy, as well as badly-needed UN reform and capacity-building to create a revitalised UN capable of fulfilling the promise of the Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of upholding international law.",107,53951,200705
Work for the achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals and continue to support the global campaign to Make Poverty History.,107,53951,200705
"Incrementally increase Overseas Development Assistance to 1% of GNP by 2010, ring-fence the ODA budget and keep all such aid un-tied.",107,53951,200705
Make poverty reduction and the reduction of inequality in all its forms key goals of Irish development policy.,107,53951,200705
Ensure policy transparency at all stages and work in partnership with actors in developing countries.,107,53951,200705
Continue our policy of critical but positive engagement in the EU.,108,53951,200705
Take a firm stance at EU level that the proposed EU Constitution and its neo-liberal substance have been expressly rejected and must not be reintroduced by stealth or otherwise.,110,53951,200705
Propose suspension of all Association Trade Agreements between the EU and,201,53951,200705
countries engaged in serious human rights violations including Israel and Turkey.,110,53951,200705
All candidates standing for the United Left Alliance must sign the following pledge:The United Left Alliance has no confidence in conservative parties and believes that the interest of the poor and those on middle incomes cannot be furthered by coalition government with such parties.,305,53021,201102
"Accordingly, Alliance Oireachtas members will not give any  support by voting  or abstaining to any  government or proposed government, including a “national government”, containing conservative parties including Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.",305,53021,201102
The Alliance believes that the super-rich should pay for the economic crisis.,415,53021,201102
"Accordingly, Alliance local authority representatives will vote against any local authority estimates including service charges on the general public.",415,53021,201102
"These charges include waste disposal charges, water charges or sewage and other such charges.",415,53021,201102
Alliance local authority representatives will also vote against any cuts in public services provided by local authorities.,504,53021,201102
The United Left Alliance is vehemently opposed to the abuse of public funds through unnecessary travel on publicly funded expenses.,304,53021,201102
Alliance public representatives will vote against estimates which provide for an individualised budget for travel to conferences or other events to be drawn down solely at the discretion of the members.,303,53021,201102
"Alliance public representatives will not attend at public expense, any conference or other event in Ireland or abroad which would be viewed by a reasonable person to be a junket.",303,53021,201102
"Any conference or other event which Alliance public representatives attend at public expense shall be demonstrably related to advancing the ability of public representatives to more effectively represent their constituents, shall be demonstrably in the interest of working class representation and shall be compatible with the political programme of the Alliance.",303,53021,201102
"In the event that a member of the Alliance attends a conference or other event compatible with the above guidelines, he or she should take only necessary expenses.",303,53021,201102
"Any member of the United Left Alliance who participates in a conference or other event at public expense, whether in Ireland or abroad, which is a junket or an expenses earning racket, shall be excluded from the Alliance.",303,53021,201102
"The economic crisis is resulting in an unprecedented onslaught on living standards, spiralling mass unemployment and a dramatic rise in poverty.",415,53021,201102
"Meanwhile billions is being taken from working people and given to bankers, builders and international speculators.",415,53021,201102
The newly formed United Left Alliance (ULA) is opposed to the governments’ bailouts and the slash and burn policies which are only making the crisis worse.,409,53021,201102
"In the general election we aim to provide a real alternative to the establishment parties as well as Labour and Sinn Fein, who also accept the capitalist market and refuse to rule out coalition with right wing parties.",415,53021,201102
The approach of a Fine Gael / Labour government in power would not be fundamentally different than this government.,305,53021,201102
"The ULA will be standing candidates throughout the country and we are inviting all people, campaigns and groups that want to fight for real change and who agree with our demands to become part of the Alliance.",305,53021,201102
"1.  Rejects so-called solutions to  the economic crises based on slashing public expenditure, welfare payments and workers’ pay.",504,53021,201102
There can be no just or sustainable solution  to  the crisis based on  the capitalist market.,415,53021,201102
Instead we favour democratic and public control over resources so  that social need is prioritised over profit.,413,53021,201102
2.   Those elected as part of the alliance will not do any deals or support any coalition with any  of the right wing parties particularly Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.,415,53021,201102
"We are committed to building  a mass left alternative to unite working people, whether public or private  sector, Irish or  migrant, with the unemployed, welfare recipients, pensioners and students in  the struggle to  change society.",415,53021,201102
1. End the bailout of banks and developers.,415,53021,201102
The ULA says scrap NAMA and end the bailout of the banks and developers.,415,53021,201102
"Take the banks, finance houses, major construction companies and development land into democratic public ownership and use them for the benefit of people, not the profit of the few.",413,53021,201102
Democratic public ownership of the banks would guarantee the savings of ordinary bank account holders but would give no commitment to pay the bondholders and financial speculators who helped cause the global crisis.,413,53021,201102
"We want to use resources, including the huge numbers of vacant properties, to provide facilities and social and affordable homes for all, to buy or rent.",413,53021,201102
Reduce total mortgages and repayments to affordable levels to reflect the real cost of the property and outlaw repossessions/evictions of families from their homes on the basis of inability to pay.,412,53021,201102
2. Tax the greedy not the needy,415,53021,201102
Ireland is not a poor country.,0,53021,201102
Massive amounts of wealth were generated during the boom.,415,53021,201102
The problem is that such wealth is in the hands of a tiny superrich minority.,415,53021,201102
We completely reject the notion that all this wealth has suddenly disappeared.,415,53021,201102
"It is also the case that many companies, especially multinationals, remain profitable.",415,53021,201102
"The ULA stands for a progressive taxation system where corporation tax on the massive profits made in Ireland would be increased, which together with a steeply progressive income tax would shift the tax burden from working people to big business and the rich.",415,53021,201102
"We also demand a wealth tax on the assets of the rich, increases in capital gains tax and an end to all tax loopholes for the rich.",415,53021,201102
"We oppose all stealth and double taxes including bin charges and plans to introduce water charges, a property tax, or a “household tax”.",415,53021,201102
We oppose the inclusion of the low paid in the tax net.,701,53021,201102
3. End the jobs crisis,408,53021,201102
The ULA condemns the complete failure of the government and the private sector to preserve or create jobs.,408,53021,201102
Their policies are deflationary and are making the jobs crisis worse.,305,53021,201102
"We call for a real social development programme that could create hundreds of thousands of jobs building necessary infrastructure like public transport, green energy projects, broadband, child care, schools, hospitals, health centres and other community facilities.",411,53021,201102
We oppose plans to sell off state companies.,413,53021,201102
Instead these companies should be used as the vehicle for job creation.,413,53021,201102
"End the reliance on the private sector, use democratic public ownership of wealth and natural resources and the banks to provide jobs by the launching a state programme of industrial development and innovation to build the productive capacity of the economy.",413,53021,201102

The Green Party firmly believes that our current political system has failed the people.,204,53110,201102
The depth of the crisis that the country finds itself in at the moment requires reform at all levels of public life.,204,53110,201102

The Green Party believes that one of the first actions the next Government should take is to consult with the Irish people to see if they wish to put in place a Citizen’s Assembly which would draw up a new draft constitution for the country.,204,53110,201102
The draft constitution would then be put to referendum.,204,53110,201102

Amend the system of State funding to political parties so that a proportion of such funding is linked to a requirement for a political party to have at least 40% of its candidates at a general election from both genders.,706,53110,201102
The legislation would include a sunset clause for the ending of gender candidate quotas,202,53110,201102

At the same time we will introduce legislation to set this new system on a statutory footing.,303,53110,201102

Renegotiate the fiscal strategy to promote growth and fairness,410,53320,201102

Labour does not accept that the EU/IMF deal provides a workable basis for restoring the Irish economy.,110,53320,201102
"Labour in government will engage with the EU and the IMF to renegotiate the deal, so as to achieve fair and realistic terms  for Ireland and for the Irish people.",110,53320,201102
"The EU/IMF deal provides funding to support a process of downsizing and restructuring in the Irish banking system, so as to restore international confidence and ensure that the  system can fund itself – i.e. that the banks will be able to function  without support from the ECB.",414,53320,201102
Labour will apply the following principles to the restructuring and down-sizing of the banks:,414,53320,201102

Labour will insist that an  adequate pool of credit is available to fund small and  medium-sized businesses in  the real economy during the re-structuring and downsizing programme.,402,53320,201102
"Labour will ensure that, at the  end of the process, a strong and robust banking system exists that will serve the needs  of the real Irish economy.",414,53320,201102
"The banks will have to provide detailed plans on how this will be achieved, including the number of SME lenders to  be involved in achieving the targets, how many new SME clients will a bank achieve, and  how much will be focused onto  existing clients.",402,53320,201102
"Labour will seek to agree more effective alternatives to the  transfer of further portfolios of smaller property loans to NAMA (NAMA2), given the difficulties this will create in  the management of such loanbooks.",412,53320,201102
Labour is opposed to further fire-sales of bank assets which  impose greater losses than necessary.,413,53320,201102
We do not support the NAMA3 asset warehousing proposal as a solution that can be implemented in a timely manner.,413,53320,201102
"Labour will explore all options to minimise the cost of re-structuring, including asset insurance models, and  to increase the availability of affordable funding to the banking system in the interim period to provide the real economy with credit.",402,53320,201102
Labour will seek to dispose of the public stakes in the banks as soon as possible at the best possible return to the taxpayer.,414,53320,201102
"Labour believes that a restructured banking system should include a specialist stateowned, but strictly independent, investment bank, focused on  funding investment to support the strategic needs of the Irish economy,",413,53320,201102
including project finance for infrastructure and  growth capital for firms.,411,53320,201102
Such a bank would be capitalised from the funds remaining in the  NPRF and should form an ongoing part of the financial system in Ireland’s open and innovative economy.,413,53320,201102
"Labour will insist on restructuring of bank boards, to ensure replacement of directors who presided over failed lending practices.",414,53320,201102
Labour will ensure that the  regulator has sufficient powers of pre-approval of bank directors and senior  executives.,403,53320,201102
"Effective decision making in this process demands better decisionmaking structures, in contrast to the fragmented and sometimes contradictory approach that has been in evidence during the crisis to date.",305,53320,201102
"Labour will create a  strong integrated decision-making structure, which while respecting the statutory roles of the different agencies, will incorporate all relevant agencies, with effective inclusion of appropriate advice, led by senior Ministers.",305,53320,201102

"Labour in government will seek to curtail any further transfers of assets to NAMA,  and will seek alternative solutions  to the transfer of large portfolios of smaller property loans.",413,53320,201102
"Effective operations and decision making by NAMA are critical to the future of the Irish economy, in respect both of curtailing losses to the State, and in ensuring that the property market in Ireland functions normally.",408,53320,201102
The prices at which assets are sold by NAMA is critical.,401,53320,201102
"Labour will also insist  on the highest standards of transparency in the operation of NAMA,",303,53320,201102
and will work to limit the  costs associated with the agency  such as in respect of professional fees.,303,53320,201102
Labour will insist on the  fullest recovery of losses from the developers whose loans have been transferred to NAMA and who do  not meet their obligations.,401,53320,201102
"Ireland’s banking crisis clearly demonstrates how Fianna Fáil’s  philosophy of free-for-all, lighttouch regulation, without proper checks and balances risks social and  economic catastrophe.",305,53320,201102
"Labour will restore the soundness  and credibility of the Irish banking sector so that it can again play its valuable social and economic role – a  safe haven for savings, a facilitator of payments, a responsible lender for productive investment and important family purchases.",414,53320,201102
"In the future, regulation must be based not only on sound principles, but on clear, enforceable rules  backed up by stringent oversight and sanctions where necessary.",403,53320,201102
"The Central Bank should be charged with monitoring balance sheet growth at financial institutions under its  jurisdiction, and in the financial system as a whole, and on the sustainability of the funding mix, reporting annually to the Minister for Finance and recommending remedial action if necessary.",403,53320,201102
"Once the banks are put on a sound footing, efforts should be made to accelerate a move to the Basel III  regime with more onerous capital and reporting requirements.",414,53320,201102
"Long before the most recent banking crisis, Irish banks established a  track record on over-charging their customers.",403,53320,201102
Irish consumers need a  reinforced watchdog with real teeth and the will to take on the bankers.,403,53320,201102
Fianna Fáil have hived off the  consumer protection function of the Financial Regulator to the National Consumer Agency.,305,53320,201102
It is essential  that its quasi-judicial role in terms  of investigating wrongdoings  and imposing sanctions is not watered down.,403,53320,201102
"Enhanced coordination is needed  between the Financial Services  Ombudsman, the Office of the  Director of Corporate Enforcement, the National Consumer Agency, and the Head of Financial Regulation at the Central Bank.",403,53320,201102
There should be a  one-stop-shop portal for consumers with issues with financial service  providers rather than having to navigate these myriad bodies.,403,53320,201102
"Over time, the banking sector must pay a fair contribution to cleaning up the mess for which it is responsible.",408,53320,201102
"When the Irish banking system has been put back on its feet, fully recapitalised, and able to access interbank markets, Labour will  introduce a bank levy based on the size of a bank’s liabilities (other than shareholders’ capital).",412,53320,201102
Labour will insist on the fullest recovery of losses from the developers whose loans have been transferred to NAMA,401,53320,201102
"Because of the important role that banks play in the wider economy, they cannot just be wound up in the same way as other businesses when they are bankrupt.",414,53320,201102
"This should not mean, however, that taxpayers are on the hook for banks’ debts.",414,53320,201102
"Ireland  should work with our European Partners to develop a comprehensive new Special Resolution Regime that ensures protection of banks’ depositors,",108,53320,201102
but allows for appropriate burden sharing with other creditors.,408,53320,201102
Bonuses in the financial sector have  grown out of all proportion with their social and economic value and  have encouraged risk-taking that is ultimately borne by the taxpayer.,416,53320,201102
"All remuneration schemes at banks  subject to state support should undergo a fundamental review to ensure an alignment of interest between banks, their staff and the  taxpayers who have borne such a heavy burden to keep them open.",412,53320,201102
"Opportunities should be explored (for instance through JEREMIE, run by the EIF) for the launch of a Regional Investment Fund by refocusing some of our remaining structural funds which have yet to be drawn down from Brussels.",411,53320,201102
This  would be a revolving fund where the money can be re-invested.,411,53320,201102
"Across Ireland, viable, profitable, well-run businesses are going to the wall because they can’t access credit.",402,53320,201102
Labour will introduce an SME  Working Capital Guarantee Scheme which would ensure that viable  small and family businesses can get the loans they need.,402,53320,201102
Labour will insist on a full and proper investigation into the blanket bank guarantee,304,53320,201102
Labour is committed to maintaining a mutual and community component in our financial system.,405,53320,201102
Ireland’s credit unions have a rich tradition  and a track record of providing loans in communities and workplaces across the country.,405,53320,201102
The credit union movement has an important role to play in Ireland’s future financial architecture and the movement  deserves support in its endeavours to increasingly modernise and professionalise the sector.,405,53320,201102
This will involve a fair and impartial review of credit union regulation.,403,53320,201102
The blanket bank guarantee was the most disastrous policy decision in the history of the state.,305,53320,201102
Labour will insist that a full and proper investigation into this decision and the events leading up to it  is completed and that there are public hearings by the relevant Oireachtas Committee.,305,53320,201102
Labour is committed to tackling the problem of financial exclusion through measures such as the introduction of basic bank accounts.,503,53320,201102
We also believe that a new  partnership should be sought to provide banking services through the Post Office Network.,413,53320,201102
"Labour supports the future development of the IFSC as a source of future growth in high value employment, subject to appropriate regulation, including the development of Green financial services",416,53320,201102

"The Fiscal Strategy set out in the EU/IMF deal, however, involves excessive  austerity, which will put growth and job creation at risk.",410,53320,201102
Labour is proposing a strategy that will maximise investment and growth.,410,53320,201102
Extend the deadline for achieving the 3% of GDP deficit target to 2016,410,53320,201102
Implement a net adjustment of €7.1 billion in  the period 2012-2014,414,53320,201102
A fair and balanced approach to achieving savings,503,53320,201102
A new strategic approach to achieve better public spending,303,53320,201102
Establish a Strategic Investment Bank to invest in the Irish economy using resources in the National Pension Reserve Fund,413,53320,201102
"As a result of the mismanagement of the economy by Fianna Fáil, Ireland is dependent on the IMF/EU loan facility to fund the fiscal deficit.",305,53320,201102
"Labour has consistently supported the objective of restoring fiscal stability, in line with our obligations as a member of the Eurozone,",414,53320,201102
and  as a necessary requirement for economic stability and long-run growth.,410,53320,201102
"Labour does not accept, however, that the fiscal strategy devised by the discredited Fianna Fáil government and included in the EU/IMF deal provides a basis for economic recovery or for maximising long-term growth.",110,53320,201102
"In particular, the excessive austerity in the Fianna Fáil plan, endorsed by Fine Gael, poses an unacceptable risk to economic recovery.",305,53320,201102
Labour does not accept thatthe fiscal strategy devised by the discredited Fianna Fáil government provides a basis for economic recovery,305,53320,201102
"Labour believes that the average GDP growth rate set out in the fouryear plan is achievable, provided that pro-growth policies are adopted.",410,53320,201102
"These include action to enhance competitiveness, to ensure adequate flows of credit, to promote investment",410,53320,201102
and an appropriate fiscal strategy.,414,53320,201102
The Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael austerity programme does not allow sufficient room for economic growth and employment creation.,410,53320,201102
The scale and nature of the cuts being proposed also pose risks to medium and long-term economic growth and to social cohesion.,410,53320,201102
therefore seek to renegotiate the fiscal strategy in the IMF/EU deal.,110,53320,201102
"In respect of the fiscal year 2011, Labour will negotiate with the EU and the IMF to ensure that adequate resources are available in 2011 to  fund key jobs strategies and reforms in the health sector.",410,53320,201102
"We believe these  funds should be provided from cash balances, and not through further expenditure cuts.",504,53320,201102
"It is clear that the Universal Social  Charge was not properly thought through, and that it is having a dramatic impact on the incomes of many families.",503,53320,201102
"The charge has been introduced at a time when  other taxes are increasing, as well as household bills like VHI fees.",408,53320,201102
"This  is causing particular hardship to some families, including working widows and elderly people.",706,53320,201102
"Labour will conduct a detailed review of the  impact of the USC to identify the families that have been hardest hit,  and will reform the tax accordingly.",503,53320,201102
"We will fund these changes by extending the 10% rate of USC on incomes over €100,000 to include  employees’ incomes over €100,000,  and by changes to capital taxes.",408,53320,201102
"Labour proposes a net fiscal adjustment in 2012-2014 of €7.1  billion, so as to allow adequate room for jobs and recovery.",414,53320,201102
Labour will complete the reduction in the deficit to below 3% of GDP by no later than 2016.,414,53320,201102
"Labour believes that the composition of the adjustment should be fairer and more balanced, including fairer taxation and on-going investment in education and other vital services,  which are essential to social solidarity and to long-term economic growth.",504,53320,201102
"Ireland needs to take a new  approach to public and private capital investment that reflects the new realities of the economy and the constraints on public resources, while also incorporating the new funding that will be available through Labour’s Strategic Investment Bank.",411,53320,201102
"Labour in government will commission a new study of Ireland’s investment needs (similar to the 2006 ESRI study), and draw up a National Development Plan covering the seven-year period 2012-2019.",411,53320,201102
"In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, Labour will prioritise investment in education,",506,53320,201102
"in health,",504,53320,201102
in science and  technology,411,53320,201102
and in job-creation.,410,53320,201102
"Labour will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period.",410,53320,201102
"Labour’s strategy is to support the development of an investment economy, while maximising the return to the public from major programmes of investment.",410,53320,201102
"Given the need for fiscal  consolidation, it will be necessary to curtail current expenditure in the immediate future.",414,53320,201102
"While this  will involve difficult decisions, it  will also afford the opportunity to reform the public service to enhance efficiency and eliminate waste.",303,53320,201102
"Rather than adopting a piece-meal, cheese-paring approach Labour will insist on a properly planned multi-annual expenditure strategy.",404,53320,201102
"To this end, Labour will conduct a  Comprehensive Spending Review and Waste Audit that will examine  all areas of public expenditure.",404,53320,201102
"This will be markedly different to the ‘Bord Snip’ exercise, in its purpose and in the way it is conducted.",404,53320,201102
"The Comprehensive Spending Review and Waste Audit will  be a major exercise in strategic budgeting and will involve a fundamental assessment of all  spending programmes, examining their objectives and how those objectives are achieved.",404,53320,201102
The purpose of strategic budgeting is to find the most cost effective ways to provide services to the public and to improve future growth and productivity.,404,53320,201102
"It will take account of the changing needs of modern Ireland, and  will be conducted on a ‘whole of  government’ basis.",404,53320,201102
"Learning from the experience in other countries, the spending review will be led, not by external consultants, but by government Ministers and the Secretary General of each Department, co-ordinated from the centre of government.",404,53320,201102
"It will adopt a three-year time horizon, resulting in a plan for public expenditure for the period 2012-2014.",404,53320,201102
This exercise should be an immediate priority for government and will be concluded in time to feed into Budget 2012.,404,53320,201102
"As part of this exercise, Labour will include a ‘surrender and re-grant’ clause, whereby Departments that propose savings in one programme would be able to propose re-cycling of some of those savings into other priority areas, subject to a ‘reducing ceiling’ on aggregate budgets.",303,53320,201102
The ‘reducing ceiling’ means that non-pay budgets will be required to be reduced by at least 2% per annum over three years on an aggregate basis – the percentage savings achieved will vary across departments in line with policy priorities.,303,53320,201102
Labour will also seek to enhance the local flexibility,301,53320,201102
available to public service managers in how they deploy their budgets to achieve maximum efficiency and service quality.,303,53320,201102
Non-Commercial Semi-State Bodies  or quangos have mushroomed in recent years.,303,53320,201102
Labour is concerned about the value-for-money being achieved by these bodies and by the lack of accountability associated with them.,303,53320,201102
"The Comprehensive Spending Review and Waste Audit will include a full evaluation of all  quangos, with each body being required to justify its continued existence outside of its parent department.",303,53320,201102
Remaining quangos will be required to be properly accountable to the Oireachtas.,303,53320,201102
"Labour is proposing a series of amalgamations of quangos relating to utilities regulation, equality, industrial development and broadcasting that will both save money and achieve greater policy coherence.",303,53320,201102
"In order to close the fiscal deficit, it  is vital that we reduce the cost of  Fianna Fáil’s failure to address the  problem of unemployment.",505,53320,201102
"Labour is proposing a series of strategies to tackle the growing problem of long-term unemployment, and in doing so to reduce the associated expenditures on social welfare.",701,53320,201102
We will also launch an all-out  campaign to tackle the problem of welfare fraud.,505,53320,201102
Labour will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review and Waste Audit that will examine all areas of public expenditure,404,53320,201102
"At a time when savings are being sought across the public service, the political system must also show leadership.",303,53320,201102
"Labour is proposing a cap on all Ministerial and public sector salaries, corresponding reductions in the salaries of Ministers of State, reductions in the number of paid chairs of Oireachtas Committees  and abolition of the Oireachtas  allowance paid to Ministers who have constituency offices staffed by civil servants.",303,53320,201102
Labour is proposing reform in the transport arrangements for Ministers including a reduction in the number of Garda drivers.,303,53320,201102
The arrangements for Ministerial pensions and severance packages have rightly been the cause of public outrage.,303,53320,201102
"Labour will ensure that in future these arrangements are set by an independent person, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General.",303,53320,201102
"As part of the process of fiscal consolidation, it is necessary to reduce the public service pay bill.",303,53320,201102
"Our proposals are based on a reduction of 18,000 in public service numbers in the period 2011-2014.",303,53320,201102
Public employment ceilings will be reassessed during the Comprehensive Spending Review and Waste Audit to ensure that the maximum savings are being achieved and that frontline services are being protected.,303,53320,201102
Labour will work the Croke Park  Agreement.,405,53320,201102
It is essential that the agreement should result in savings to the Exchequer and that the pace of implementation of the Agreement be accelerated.,405,53320,201102
"In order to achieve recovery and reform, it will be necessary to re-allocate resources to areas  of strategic priority.",504,53320,201102
This means achieving more savings in order to re-invest in reform and development.,504,53320,201102
Labour’s adjustment proposals provide for resources to fund a €500  million annual jobs package.,410,53320,201102
"As part of Labour’s health strategy, the cost of providing health care in Ireland will be driven down, with €489  million being provided to ensure a major shift towards primary care.",504,53320,201102
Additional resources will be provided in key areas of education,506,53320,201102
and criminal justice to drive reform.,605,53320,201102
Labour has long argued for a fair and balanced tax structure in Ireland and  we will seek to renegotiate the EU/IMF deal to achieve this objective.,503,53320,201102
"It is an important principle of taxation that those who have the  most, must contribute the most,",503,53320,201102
"and  that revenue-raising must begin with reform, rather than constantly delaying it as Fianna Fáil have done.",408,53320,201102
Labour does not support further impositions of income tax on people on middle and modest incomes in  the period 2012-2014.,704,53320,201102
"We propose no increases in income tax for people earning less than €100,000.",704,53320,201102
"We  will extend the 10% USC rate to  employee incomes over €100,000.",503,53320,201102
"Labour will insert a new provision in the tax code to ensure that high earners (tax units with incomes  over €250,000) must comply with a Minimum Effective Tax Rate to be  set at 30%.",503,53320,201102
This will impose a fair restriction on the capacity of high earners to reduce their tax bills  through tax planning.,503,53320,201102
"Labour in government introduced the 12.5% corporation profits tax rate, and we will insist that it remains  in place.",402,53320,201102
Reforms to the regime for off-setting corporate losses against Corporation Tax can be adopted to increase the yield from the tax,402,53320,201102
without affecting Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for  inward investment.,407,53320,201102
"Labour will prioritise the elimination of unnecessary tax expenditures, as we have been proposing for many years.",303,53320,201102
"These include the legacy property reliefs, and phasing down of the amount of interest that can be  offset against rental income for tax purposes to 25%.",503,53320,201102
"Labour believes that the total  quantum of tax relief currently in place for pensions is no longer supportable, and that the distribution of relief at present is not fair or equitable.",503,53320,201102
"Labour will target a further reduction of €500 million in  the total amount of relief, but rather  than simply standardising the rate of relief, Labour favours an approach that retains strong incentives for people to invest in pensions while also making the system fairer.",503,53320,201102
"This will include capping the tax relief on pension contributions from both employers and employees, reducing the maximum tax-free lump sum, reducing the maximum pension fund and including pension tax relief in the minimum effective tax rate.",503,53320,201102
Labour favours the introduction  of new progressive structures for Capital Taxes.,503,53320,201102
threshold will be taxed at 30% and  the balance at 35%.,408,53320,201102
These measures  will raise €236 million in a full year.,408,53320,201102
The change in Capital Acquisitions Tax will be introduced in 2011 to  finance changes in the Universal Social Charge.,408,53320,201102
Labour believes that appropriate tax rules have a role to play in protecting our environment.,416,53320,201102
"Labour will  increase the carbon tax to €25 per  tonne,",416,53320,201102
with an offset of €40 million  to fund fuel poverty measures.,503,53320,201102
Labour supports a broadly based tax on packaging as proposed by Comhar that will raise €60 million.,416,53320,201102
Labour is proposing a 1% increase in the standard rate of VAT that will  raise €310 million in a full year.,412,53320,201102
Labour’s proposals include modest increases in excise on wine and  cigarettes.,412,53320,201102
Labour will prioritise action to reduce losses to the  Exchequer from smuggling through stronger revenue enforcement.,605,53320,201102
"Labour accepts that it will be necessary to introduce a site value charge, in order to prevent higher taxes on work.",408,53320,201102
"The Government has  not, however, carried out sufficient  work to allow such a charge to be introduced in the short-term.",305,53320,201102
"Further  detailed study will be required to devise a fair basis for such a charge that takes account of the value of  property in different regions,",503,53320,201102
"the need to exempt some categories of homeowners, and the need to  take account of those who have  recently paid large sums in stamp duty or who are in negative equity.",704,53320,201102
"Any charge of this sort, therefore, cannot be set in place before 2014.",305,53320,201102
"Accordingly, Labour will publish a Green Paper by the end of 2012 on how the charge can be structured in a fair and efficient manner.",503,53320,201102
"As  an interim measure, Labour will  increase the second homes levy by  €300 to yield €95 million.",503,53320,201102
"Labour will take action to deal with the scandal of tax exiles, and will further strengthen revenue action to reduce tax evasion",303,53320,201102
"Labour will insist on action being taken to deal with the scandal  of tax exiles, and we will further  strengthen revenue action to reduce tax-evasion.",605,53320,201102
"Throughout the crisis, Labour has been clear that cuts alone will not  solve the problem.",410,53320,201102
"Ireland needs a strategy for jobs and growth,",410,53320,201102
and the lack of action on jobs has made the crisis in the public finances and in the banks even worse.,410,53320,201102
"While  difficult decisions are needed,",414,53320,201102
we  also need a strategy to grow our way out of our predicament.,410,53320,201102
"Despite the financial crisis at home and abroad, we are living in a period of opportunity for the Irish economy.",410,53320,201102
"In the advanced economies, economic  growth is now increasingly driven by what is known as the ‘knowledge economy’, with new technologies driving economic growth both in knowledge-intensive sectors, and more widely across the whole economy.",411,53320,201102
"At the same time, the global trading system is expanding, and the emerging economies such as China and India present enormous opportunities for Irish companies.",407,53320,201102
"Export growth in Ireland is picking up, and competitiveness has improved.",407,53320,201102
What we need now is a coherent  strategy to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to us.,404,53320,201102
Labour’s fiscal strategy provides for a €500 million Jobs Fund  to finance a series of pro-jobs initiatives that involve elements  of current expenditure.,409,53320,201102
The fund would be administered by a Cabinet sub-committee.,409,53320,201102
"Proposals from Departments, agencies and other bodies, including the private sector, would be considered on the basis  of their contribution to an overall  jobs strategy and would be funded accordingly.",409,53320,201102
The agencies thus funded would not be immune from  making efficiencies in their budgets – funding from the Jobs Fund would be dependent on demonstrated additionality to existing operations.,409,53320,201102
"To achieve growth, the Fianna Fáil casino economy must be replaced with by the investment economy.",410,53320,201102
The Irish banking system has not provided the kind of investment finance that is required to meet Ireland’s investment needs.,411,53320,201102
"To  fill the gap, Labour is proposing the establishment of a Strategic Investment Bank.",413,53320,201102
The Strategic Investment Bank will be established in two phases.,413,53320,201102
It will be set up initially as a vehicle to invest the remaining funds in the National Pension Reserve  Fund in projects that will enhance infrastructure and boost growth in the Irish economy.,411,53320,201102
independent and will invest on a commercial basis.,408,53320,201102
"Over time, and when market  conditions normalise, this vehicle  will be developed into a functioning bank that takes deposits and raises long term financing.",413,53320,201102
Labour believes that the Strategic Investment Bank should be an essential component of the re-structured banking system.,413,53320,201102
"The bank would be set up as an independent commercial operation, using €2 billion of the National  Pension Reserve Fund as capital.",413,53320,201102
It would operate on a strict arms-length basis from government.,414,53320,201102
"Irish citizens and the Irish Diaspora would be encouraged to make deposits in the bank, and to purchase Citizen’s Bonds, which would be a way to invest in the recovery of the Irish economy, and would be of different maturities.",413,53320,201102
"The bank would attract  funding from a number of sources, including consumer deposits and wholesale markets (once market conditions normalise).",413,53320,201102
The Strategic Investment Bank would be a key lender to SMEs and innovative firms.,402,53320,201102
The Enterprise Agencies would develop relationships with the Strategic Investment Bank to facilitate introductions of highpotential firms.,402,53320,201102
"Investment decisions, however, would remain the exclusive  preserve of the bank.",413,53320,201102
The Strategic Investment Bank would also support investment in large infrastructure projects.,411,53320,201102
"Competitiveness has improved during the past three years, but we need to ensure that, as growth returns, these gains are not eroded.",410,53320,201102
"In particular, it is important that costs in the protected sectors of the economy do not undermine the capacity of the traded sector to compete.",410,53320,201102
"To maintain and enhance competitiveness, Labour is proposing the following measures:",410,53320,201102
Labour believes that negotiated wage policies can potentially be an important tool of macroeconomic policy in a small open economy.,405,53320,201102
"We will explore options for developing such an agreement, which may include national and/or sectoral wage norms.",405,53320,201102
Labour believes that investment and job creation can be enhanced through structured multiannual agreements that incorporate wage restraint.,405,53320,201102
Wage competitiveness should not be confused with a low wage agenda.,701,53320,201102
Labour is opposed to the reduction in the minimum wage agreed by Fianna Fáil with the European Union and the IMF and we will reverse it.,412,53320,201102
"The national  minimum wage affects fewer than 3% of the work force, who are on  the lowest rung of the labour force ladder.",412,53320,201102
"Labour will reform the JLC  system,",412,53320,201102
but this cannot be used as the basis to undermine the rights and conditions of employment of vulnerable workers.,701,53320,201102
Labour will support robust competition policy and enforcement.,402,53320,201102
We support structural reform in the professions to drive down the cost base for the traded sector.,402,53320,201102
Labour will enhance the quality and effectiveness of utilities regulation in Ireland.,403,53320,201102
"We favour a properly planned consolidation of the number of regulators, to make more effective use of regulatory skills.",403,53320,201102
Labour will retain the Competition Authority as a separate entity.,403,53320,201102
Labour believes that the Strategic InvestmentBank should be an essential component of the re-structured banking system,413,53320,201102
"To achieve economic growth and job creation, the Irish economy must shift from a property-based economy to a knowledge economy.",411,53320,201102
"We need to carve out new markets, and develop new products to sell in them.",407,53320,201102
Ireland has an open and entrepreneurial economy with multiple natural and developed competitive advantages.,401,53320,201102
"We need a government that will help that economy to grow by driving trade, innovation and productivity growth.",410,53320,201102
Use Labour’s s500 million jobs fund to grow employment in sectors where Ireland already has a competitive advantage,410,53320,201102
Make the strategic decision to target the development of new markets for Ireland in the emerging economies,407,53320,201102
Appoint a trade czar to co-ordinate action across government in opening these fast growing markets,407,53320,201102
Plug the gap in our national system of innovation by investing to turn new scientific advances into jobs,411,53320,201102
Create innovation centres focused on  commercialisation of research,411,53320,201102
Competitiveness and productivity gains which generated strong exportled growth formed the basis for the Celtic Tiger from 1994 to 2002.,410,53320,201102
We need a renewal of this strategy in order to create the foundations for  future economic and employment growth.,410,53320,201102
However the previous blueprint will have to change.,305,53320,201102
"New economic realities, the imperative to decarbonise our economy,",416,53320,201102
and the need to develop a new generation of export champions will require a reset in our trade and enterprise policy.,407,53320,201102
"Labour will place a much stronger emphasis on the promotion of services exports, including software, engineering, financial services, education and culture.",407,53320,201102
Labour will establish a Trade Council to strengthen cooperation and coordination across key departments,407,53320,201102
"To support the development of exporting SMEs, we will seek reform of EU procurement rules so that a greater portion of all public procurement goes to small and medium sized enterprises.",402,53320,201102
We will promptly implement all the recommendations in the Trading and Investing in the Smart Economy Report.,411,53320,201102
"In particular, we will establish a Trade Council to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all of the key departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade and exports.",407,53320,201102
will be divided equally between government and private sector representatives who have experience in establishing and growing exportoriented business both in Ireland   and abroad.,407,53320,201102
"We will appoint a high profile Trade and Enterprise czar to work with in tandem with the  Trade Council, who will be able to  draw on full diplomatic and civil service resources and who will  report directly to the Minister for Enterprise and the Taoiseach.",407,53320,201102
"A key pillar of Labour’s new enterprise strategy will be to position Ireland to develop better trade relationships with the rising economies of Brazil, Russia, India ,  and China.",407,53320,201102
Labour will establish a local trade  and investment team reporting to the local Irish Ambassador or  Head of Mission and the Minister  for Enterprise in each of the target emerging countries and other priority markets.,407,53320,201102
"These teams will execute a detailed local market  plan, with progress against targets reviewed annually.",407,53320,201102
"At home, Labour in government will draw on the economic strengths and connections of Ireland’s immigrant communities by appointing a representative from each of the BRICS and other strategic markets resident in Ireland as trade champions for their respective countries, reporting to both the Trade Council and the Minister for  Enterprise.",407,53320,201102
Trade champions will have a mission of promoting trade to and from Ireland and will be supported by the Department of Enterprise.,407,53320,201102
"Labour will take initiatives to deepen educational cooperation with the emerging economies, financed from Labour’s Jobs Fund.",407,53320,201102
Innovation is the single most important factor in the transition to a sustainable investment economy.,411,53320,201102
"While Ireland has a number of  key strengths in this area, such as high quality scientific research institutions, scientists and engineers, our innovation system has a number of deficiencies.",411,53320,201102
"Labour’s plan for innovation is directly aimed at addressing these weaknesses, while building on our existing strengths.",411,53320,201102
"Labour will subsume the current  activities and functions of Forfas, the  Innovation Taskforce, the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation and the Sustainable  Energy Authority into a newlyestablished Innovation Strategy Agency an independent agency within the IDA / Enterprise Ireland structure, whose role will be to stimulate  technology-enabled innovation in the areas which offer the greatest scope for boosting growth and productivity.",411,53320,201102
"Labour’s Innovation Strategy Agency will promote and support investment in technology research, development and commercialisation beyond the basic research supported by Science Foundation Ireland, as well as advising government on how to remove barriers to innovation and accelerate  the exploitation of new technologies.",411,53320,201102
The majority of the members of the board of the ISA will be drawn  from industry and finance from both Ireland and abroad with  experience of technology change and innovation.,411,53320,201102
"The Innovation Strategy Agency will focus its work by targeting key technology areas and sectors where innovation can be applied including but not limited to high value manufacturing, advanced materials, nanotechnology, bioscience, electronics, photonics and electrical systems and information and communication technology.",411,53320,201102
"The ISA will also focus on the  application of technological innovation in established sectors of  the economy like energy generation and supply, transport, creative industries, high-value services and architecture and construction   by identifying challenges, establishing priorities and developing strategies which specify the necessary actions to transition to a more innovative approach.",411,53320,201102
"The ISA will promote Ireland’s full engagement with the ‘Innovative Union’ proposals issued by the European Commission in October 2010 as one of the seven flagship initiatives under the EU2020  Strategy, with the specific aim of refocusing R&D and innovation policy on major challenges and at turning inventions into products.",411,53320,201102
"There is a critical gap between the basic research promoted and funded by Science Foundation Ireland and third level institutions,  and its subsequent development into a commercial opportunity for investors.",411,53320,201102
This gap can only be closed by making new technologies investment ready.,411,53320,201102
"The Innovation Strategy Agency will be tasked with closing this gap through the establishment of a network of Technology Research Centres focused on applied technological research in specific areas, to be linked to appropriate higher-education institutions.",411,53320,201102
The centres will accelerate the  exploitation of new technologies by providing infrastructure that bridges the gap between research and technology commercialisation.,411,53320,201102
"The establishment of these centres  will build on the approach already adopted with the Tyndall Centre on ICT and the International Energy Research Centre (IERC) in UCC where  government, industry and academics partner to focus on applied research that will lead to concrete results and  commercial applications.",411,53320,201102
"In order to promote Ireland’s strong historical tradition in science and  technology for the next generation of scientists, each centre will be  named after a renowned Irish  scientist such as Robert Boyle, Ernest Walton, Jocelyn Bell Burnell or Kathleen Lonsdale.",411,53320,201102
"Initially these centres will be funded in a three-way split between the ISA, competitive grants, and contracts with private companies.",411,53320,201102
"Over time, the centres will be expected to supplement their core funding by gaining further income from public and private sector contract research, and through the commercialisation of intellectual property.",411,53320,201102
"The ISA will initially establish three additional centres building on Tyndall and the IERC focusing on biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing.",411,53320,201102
Further centres from a number of other  areas will be selected subsequently.,411,53320,201102
The Innovation Research Centres will  also be in a position to play a role as anchor tenants in more broadlybased Science and Technology Parks that will attract private firms in the specific research area.,411,53320,201102
"Labour’s Innovation Strategy Agency will promote & supportinvestment in technology research, development & commercialisation",411,53320,201102
"As well as creating the conditions for innovation and export-led growth,",410,53320,201102
"Labour is proposing a number of sectoral strategies, which build on Ireland’s existing strengths.",408,53320,201102
"Labour’s proposals for growing employment in tourism, the green economy, the agri-food sector and in the education sector are outlined elsewhere in  this manifesto.",410,53320,201102

The community Garda service should also be supported by members of the Garda Reserve drawn from the community.,605,53320,201102

"We refuse to go back to the days when only the relatively wealthy could count on going to third level, or when a family could only afford to send one of their children to college.",506,53320,201102

"The strategy will develop an ‘Education Ireland’ brand, and  combine the ambitions and interests  of government policy with those of the higher education sector for a five year period.",407,53320,201102

"Ireland’s healthcare system is broken,",504,53320,201102
"and for thirteen years, Fianna Fáil has chosen not to fix it.",305,53320,201102
"Instead, they focused on privatising the health service, giving huge tax-payer funded windfalls to developers building super-private clinics.",504,53320,201102
"Labour in government will introduce Universal Health Insurance as a way of delivering better, more effective care for every patient, and reducing the cost of our health system.",504,53320,201102
"From our first day in office, Labour will begin the phased introduction of a Universal Health Insurance system, starting with GP care.",504,53320,201102
Access to GPs covered by primary care insurance for all by 2014,504,53320,201102

"A focus on treating mental health in the community,",504,53320,201102
with particular provision for young people,706,53320,201102
Meeting more people’s healthcare needs through the primary care system is key to reducing the overall cost of the Irish health system.,504,53320,201102
"This requires more services to be delivered at local level, instead of in hospitals, and more people being able to afford them.",504,53320,201102
"Under Labour’s plan, GP fees will be covered by universal primary care insurance.",504,53320,201102
"This universal primary care insurance will be extended to  the portion of the population who do not have a medical card on a  phased basis, so that by 2014, every person registered with a GP will be insured for primary care.",504,53320,201102
This means patients will no longer pay upfront fees when they visit their GP.,504,53320,201102
"Labour will begin this process in our first year in government, by extending primary care insurance for GP visits to people on the Long-term Illness Scheme.",504,53320,201102
"This reform will be paid for out of existing Exchequer funding, and savings in the health budget, which will go into a Primary Care Insurance Fund.",504,53320,201102
"From this fund, GPs will be paid a capitation fee per person registered with their practice, similar to the existing medical card system, but at a lower cost to the Exchequer.",504,53320,201102
"By 2014, every person registered with a GP will be insured for primary care",504,53320,201102
"In the short term, the supply of GPs can be increased by deferring the retirement of existing GPs; by recruiting more practice nurses, who could take on up to half the average workload of a GP; and by recruiting doctors from abroad, including Irish doctors who have emigrated.",504,53320,201102
These measures will ensure that there is enough supply to meet demand in phase one of Labour’s healthcare reforms.,504,53320,201102
"In the medium to longer term, the number of GPs being trained in Ireland will need to increase.",504,53320,201102
"In order to free up more acute hospital beds, more step-down beds and home care packages need to be available to people who cannot be discharged without some posthospital care.",504,53320,201102
"To facilitate this, Labour will invest additional funds in  community and ‘step down’ care.",504,53320,201102
Labour will introduce a system of mandatory Universal Hospital Care Insurance.,504,53320,201102
"Hospital care will be paid for in much the same way we pay for it now – through Exchequer resources and insurance premiums – except that money will be paid into a Hospital Insurance Fund, which will regulate the flow of funds to hospitals and insurance companies.",504,53320,201102
"Premiums will be subsidised  according to income, ranging from a 100 per cent subsidy for people currently eligible for medical cards, to no subsidy for those who can afford to pay for their own premium.",504,53320,201102
"Public, not-for-profit, and private insurers will be obliged to offer a guaranteed ‘basket’ of insured hospital services.",504,53320,201102
The cost of insurance premiums under a Universal Hospital Care Insurance system should not change from what they are at present.,504,53320,201102
"Implementation of these reforms will result in the cost of delivering healthcare being reduced, which means that more people can be treated for a similar level of funding.",504,53320,201102
"The National Treatment Purchase  Fund (NTPF) and the purchasing arm of the HSE will come together to provide a new non-profit insurer, which will automatically enrol people with a medical card and the uninsured.",413,53320,201102
"However, like all  insurance customers, they will have the choice of whether to switch  insurer.",401,53320,201102
"Initially, half of acute hospital budgets will be paid via the Hospital Insurance Fund, which will manage risk equalisation between insurers, and fund A&E services, ambulance  services, teaching and certain very expensive and rare procedures, such as transplants.",504,53320,201102
The balance of acute hospital budgets will be paid via insurance payments based on the number of procedures they carry out.,504,53320,201102
"Instead of every patient being a ‘drain’ on a fixed hospital budget, every patient will represent a ‘gain’, giving hospitals an incentive to treat as many patients as efficiently as possible.",504,53320,201102
This is the ‘money follows the patient’ model of hospital funding that is driven by universal health insurance.,504,53320,201102
"Reform in the management of hospitals, establishment of the new public insurer for acute hospital care, and development of systems of regulation and financing will take time, which is why introducing this system will take six years.",504,53320,201102
"However, a phased introduction of universal hospital insurance will start from year one with an expansion of the role of the NTPF to purchase certain diagnostic tests for people who do not have insurance.",504,53320,201102
"Costs will be controlled through centralised negotiation of the price of drugs and professional fees by the Hospital Insurance Fund, in consultation with insurance  companies.",504,53320,201102
"This centralised negotiation of key costs, in tandem with competing insurers, is similar to the German model of  health insurance, and is critical to  controlling the cost of delivering healthcare.",504,53320,201102
"Under Universal Hospital Care Insurance, public hospitals will be given much more independence.",301,53320,201102
They will no longer be managed by the HSE.,301,53320,201102
"They will operate as independent, not-for-profit foundations or trusts, with managers accountable to their boards.",301,53320,201102
Boards  will include representatives of local communities.,301,53320,201102
"For some smaller  hospitals it will make sense for them to combine in a local hospital network, with a shared management and board.",301,53320,201102
Hospitals and hospital groups will be able to compete to supply care to private or public insurers.,301,53320,201102
This freeing of public hospitals will not be a free market in care.,504,53320,201102
A free market is not compatible with social solidarity and good planning for community health care needs.,504,53320,201102
"An unregulated market would jeopardise the survival of smaller hospitals in areas where the population is dispersed, and would run counter to the development of centres of excellence for certain  kinds of care.",504,53320,201102
"Under Universal Hospital Care Insurance, the Minister for Health  answering to the Government and Dáil Eireann will be responsible for health policy, including hospitals policy.",202,53320,201102
"Where a hospital plays an important role in supplying care in an area that cannot be fulfilled by primary care services, it will not be allowed to  close.",504,53320,201102
"If, under the system of Universal Hospital Care Insurance, that hospital is failing due to inefficiency, its management will be replaced.",504,53320,201102
"If it is failing because it needs to offer a differing package of care, it will be assisted by the Hospital Insurance Fund in achieving that change.",504,53320,201102
"In the present fiscal crisis, Labour in government will prioritise capital spending in health.",504,53320,201102
"Even with significant reforms in how we pay for healthcare, Ireland’s system needs more acute hospital beds and more step-down beds in the community.",504,53320,201102
"Labour will prioritise investment in new, modern hospitals, including the National Children’s Hospital, a new hospital for the North-East, and supports the policy objective of relocating maternity hospitals to acute hospital campuses in Limerick and Dublin.",504,53320,201102
Labour in government will also explore the scope for providing health care facilities through non-traditional financing via the Strategic Investment Bank.,504,53320,201102
The Minister for Health will be  clearly in charge of the health care system and answerable to the Government and Dáil Eireann.,202,53320,201102
The  Minister will introduce legislation to enact Universal Primary Care Insurance and Universal Hospital Care Insurance.,305,53320,201102
Labour ‘s plan does not abolish the HSE outright.,504,53320,201102
"Instead, Labour’s plan transforms what we have already, so that the functions of the HSE are split between purchasing hospital care on the one hand, and a continuation of its management of mental health, community care and social care on the other.",504,53320,201102

"guaranteeing a more equal society and life of dignity for all citizens, whether employed or unemployed.",503,53320,201102
"This crisis has underlined the importance of strong, sustainable social protection systems.",504,53320,201102
"Through the social progress clause agreed in the Lisbon Treaty, we will ensure the real social and  environmental cost of EU laws is  fully assessed before they are agreed.",108,53320,201102
The Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the role of the EU parliament in the EU legislative system.,108,53320,201102
"Labour Party MEPs, with their colleagues in the Group of Socialists and Democrats, will work for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty reforms, for the greater transparency and accountability in the work of the EU institutions and for the prioritisation of economic stability, job creation and social development.",108,53320,201102
"The Lisbon Treaty also mandates a much greater role for national parliaments in the scrutiny of EU legislation, which Labour will enforce through the Dáil committee system.",202,53320,201102
Ireland has played a constructive role in the development and operation of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.,108,53320,201102
"Labour is committed to continuing this engagement, in the context of our policy of positive neutrality,",107,53320,201102
and the reaffirmation of that neutrality by our EU partners in the Lisbon Treaty.,105,53320,201102
"With our sister parties across Europe and the Socialist International,",108,53320,201102
"Labour will work to support gradual and considered further enlargement of the Union to bring peace,",106,53320,201102
high living standards and stable growth across the continent.,108,53320,201102
"Labour supports a meaningful and equitable international agreement to avoid runaway global warming,",107,53320,201102
and will work at European level to ensure that the EU takes a lead  in these negotiations.,108,53320,201102
Such an agreement must be implemented and monitored by a democratic supervisory authority.,107,53320,201102
"Labour also supports a more coherent approach to reducing greenhouse gases across the EU, including the introduction of binding energy efficiency targets by 2020, and reform of the Emissions Trading System.",107,53320,201102
Labour will demand the highest standards of transparency and accountability from EU institutions such as the Commission and  Parliament; including regulation of lobbying.,202,53320,201102
Labour supports the nomination of candidates for the office of President  of the European Commission in advance of the 2014 European elections from the various political groupings in the European Parliament.,202,53320,201102
This step will help give voters real choices in the future  direction of Europe.,202,53320,201102
"Labour in government will maintain and encourage the clear, close, and successful co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland",605,53320,201102
"Labour is proud of our contribution to creating a more peaceful, lawful, and democratic society in Northern Ireland.",106,53320,201102
"We believe that there is considerably more potential for North/South cooperation than has been the case to date, and that this cooperation could be of mutual benefit to all of the people north and south of the border.",101,53320,201102
"Through the North/South Ministerial Council, Labour will seek the immediate publication of the Phase One Review of North/South cooperation that was included as part of the St Andrews Agreement of 2006.",101,53320,201102
"Labour will also press for the earliest possible completion of the Second Phase, identifying new areas of co-operation and implementation between the two parts of the island.",101,53320,201102
"Labour will commence additional work by the two administrations in identifying potential areas whereby savings and efficiencies could be achieved, services improved and developed, and jobs created through greater North-South co-operation.",101,53320,201102
We cannot forget that there are elements North and South that wish to destabilise and undermine the progress that has been made.,101,53320,201102
"In order to confront this threat, Labour in government will maintain and encourage the clear, close, and successful co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to deal with the threat of all dissident paramilitary groups.",101,53320,201102
Fine Gael’s number one priority in Government will be JOBS.,408,53520,201102
"The ESRI believes that 100,000 jobs can be created over 5 years by Ireland returning to 3% growth.",410,53520,201102
"As outlined in our jobs policy, Working for Our Future, Fine Gael will ensure this happens by investing in key infrastructure and establishing the right conditions for private sector job growth.",411,53520,201102
"Our goal is to make Ireland, as it was in the late 1990s, one of the best countries in the world for doing business. (See section 15)",408,53520,201102
Fine Gael believes the jobs crisis is the biggest challenge facing Ireland:,408,53520,201102
"First, because of the social misery it is causing:",701,53520,201102
"Over the last three years 300,000 people have lost their jobs - the biggest fall in employment in the OECD - while 100,000 mostly young people will emigrate over the next two years.",701,53520,201102
Emigration must not become a permanent feature of Irish life.,701,53520,201102
"Second, because we will never fix the deficit",414,53520,201102
unless we get the economy growing.,410,53520,201102
The Government has no jobs plan.,305,53520,201102
"Its only strategy is to pump tens of billions of Euros into the banks, cut the deficit largely through job-destroying tax increases, and hope for the best.",410,53520,201102
Yet no country has ever taxed or cut itself back to recovery.,410,53520,201102
"Fine Gael has a clear, credible jobs plan.",305,53520,201102
"We will create over 45,000 additional work experience, training, and internship opportunities, and increase total employment by at least 100,000 jobs by:",408,53520,201102
Focusing on budget cuts rather than job-destroying tax increases.,414,53520,201102
The international evidence is clear:,414,53520,201102
Tax hikes raise the unemployment rate by three times more than spending cuts.,505,53520,201102
Investing in the future.,411,53520,201102
"Our NewERA plan will invest an extra €7 billion in energy, communications and water to give Ireland the world class infrastructure it needs to compete.",411,53520,201102
Since it will be funded in significant part through the sale of non-strategic state assets it will not increase the Government deficit.,414,53520,201102
"NewERA will give Ireland a high-speed broadband network with speeds in the top 5 of the OECD, a “smart” energy grid that will allow us to meet national targets for renewable energy and carbon reduction, and a water system that doesn’t waste tens of millions ever year through leakages.",411,53520,201102
Supporting small and medium businesses.,403,53520,201102
We will establish a new partial loan guarantee scheme which will give small businesses the credit they desperately need.,402,53520,201102
"We will overhaul public procurement so that small companies can bid for business, and give tenants the right to have their commercial rents reviewed irrespective of any upward only or other review clauses.",402,53520,201102
We will reduce costs by opening up the closed parts of the economy to competition and target a €500 million reduction in red tape for business.,403,53520,201102
Focusing on key growth sectors.,410,53520,201102
These include education (we will introduce a new more focused strategy to attract international students);,506,53520,201102
digital media (we want Ireland to become a world class player in digital gaming);,411,53520,201102
tourism (we will abolish the travel tax if the airlines agree to re-open closed routes);,408,53520,201102
and food (Fine Gael will introduce a number of proposals to position Ireland as the “Green Food Island”).,703,53520,201102
"As stated in our banking policy, Credit Where Credit is Due, Fine Gael will reduce the budget deficit to 3% by 2014.",414,53520,201102
We want Ireland by 2016 to be borrowing only for investment purposes.,414,53520,201102
"Unless the deficit is brought under control in this way, interest costs will cripple Ireland.",414,53520,201102
"Under a Fine Gael Government, tax increases will constitute at most one-third of our measures to reduce the deficit, with any tax increases focused on areas which have a minimal impact on jobs.",414,53520,201102
"We will not increase income taxes, the 12.5% rate of corporation tax or taxes on jobs (employers’ PRSI).",414,53520,201102
"We will, however, either eliminate or restrict all of the tax shelters and tax exemptions that allow the better off to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. (See section 18)",503,53520,201102
"Fine Gael believes that the IMF/EU bail-out deal has not and will not restore investor confidence in our country, and must therefore be renegotiated to reduce the interest rate and to ensure a fairer sharing of the cost of fixing Ireland’s broken banks.",109,53520,201102
The current deal is bad for Ireland,109,53520,201102
– and bad for Europe.,109,53520,201102
Bad for Ireland.,109,53520,201102
The financial markets are closed to Ireland principally because investors are concerned that any more capital injections into the banks – the cost so far is €100 billion – will sink the Irish economy.,414,53520,201102
Bad for Europe.,109,53520,201102
Our EU partners want Ireland to return to the financial markets as soon as possible.,108,53520,201102
"However, it is difficult to see how this can happen unless the market’s concerns about the banking bailout are addressed directly.",414,53520,201102
"Fine Gael favours spending reductions over tax increases not for ideological reasons, but because the experience of other countries shows that tax hikes raise the unemployment rate by three times more than spending cuts.",505,53520,201102
Some argue that there is no further room for savings in Government spending.,505,53520,201102
"First,  Ireland’s total spending (‘General Government’) as a percentage of GNP is still higher than the EU average, even after recent budget cuts.",505,53520,201102
"Second,  a great deal of spending over the last few years has been wasted.",305,53520,201102
"Many state institutions, the HSE being the most obvious, have seen huge increases in their budgets but relatively little improvement in their services.",505,53520,201102
"Third,  Canada and Sweden in the 1990s showed that it is absolutely possible to cut spending while still growing the economy and protecting frontline services.",505,53520,201102
The secret of their success was to ensure that cuts were introduced as part of a comprehensive reform of public services.,505,53520,201102
This is exactly the approach which Fine Gael is adopting.,505,53520,201102
By cutting down on waste and inefficiency Fine Gael will keep the Old Age Contributory and Non-Contributory Pension at its current level.,504,53520,201102
"Working-age payments to carers, the blind and the disabled will also be maintained.",504,53520,201102
"We will minimise further reductions in job-seekers’ payments and other working-age social welfare payments by getting more people back to work,",505,53520,201102
and by reducing the massive levels of fraud and administrative cost in the current welfare system.,303,53520,201102
Fine Gael is convinced that the public sector has a crucial role to play in Ireland’s future.,504,53520,201102
We reject totally the idea that its contribution to Ireland can or should be captured in a narrow profit and loss statement.,504,53520,201102
"Public service is about enriching the lives of people and helping the most vulnerable in our society, not about making a profit.",504,53520,201102
"But as Fine Gael’s Reinventing Government document outlines, reform is essential. (See section 19)",303,53520,201102
Government must become smaller.,505,53520,201102
Ireland’s fiscal crisis means there is simply no other choice.,414,53520,201102
"Government has to deliver better value in order to reduce the deficit, avoid job-destroying tax increases",414,53520,201102
and protect frontline services,504,53520,201102
Government must perform better.,303,53520,201102
All too often state institutions have prioritised the interests of the providers and the insiders over the public interest.,304,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will cut costs and increase productivity through a root and branch reform programme which will generate savings of over €5 billion, or 1 euro in every 10 spent by public bodies.",303,53520,201102
Cut the number of politicians by 1/3rd and reduce back office staff working in government departments.,303,53520,201102
"Our goal is to reduce total public service headcount by 30,000 by 2014 compared to 2010.",303,53520,201102
There will be no compulsory redundancies.,303,53520,201102
"We will also set a salary cap of €200,000 for everyone.",303,53520,201102
Abolish 145 state bodies and companies.,303,53520,201102
"This will include the gradual dismantlement of the HSE and FÁS, and the creation of a single, more powerful Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission to champion the consumer, rather than the big monopolies.",403,53520,201102
Implement a majority of the non social-welfare recommendations from the McCarthy Report.,303,53520,201102
We will also follow Canada and Sweden by undertaking a full comprehensive spending review which will eliminate non-priority programmes.,303,53520,201102
"Establish new shared services for Human Resources, Information Technology and Legal Services.",303,53520,201102
This will allow 10% to be cut from the administration budgets of all departments and public bodies.; and,303,53520,201102
"5. Deliver at least 80% of the spending savings recommended by the Local Government Efficiency Review, e.g., through more shared services.",303,53520,201102
Fine Gael will reform Ireland’s hugely over-centralised model of government.,301,53520,201102
A Fine Gael Government will give frontline staff greater freedom in how they do their job and ensure that citizens have more control over services delivered to them.,301,53520,201102
We will give local authorities more responsibilities and more control over their own funding.,301,53520,201102
"We will create a “one stop shop” for all entitlements and introduce Personal Budgets for individuals, particularly in health, so they can choose the services they want and need.",303,53520,201102
We will also open up government and make it more accountable.,303,53520,201102
"All appointments at senior level will be opened up to external competition, with one-third of appointments reserved for external candidates for a 5-year period.",303,53520,201102
"The annual work objectives of the top 1,300 civil servants will be published online.",303,53520,201102
There will be no “golden handshakes” for those who fail to deliver.,303,53520,201102
Fine Gael’s New Politics is the most ambitious programme for political reform since the 1930s.,305,53520,201102
Our view is simple: Politicians cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if they are not prepared to do the same.,303,53520,201102
Fine Gael will reduce the total number of Oireachtas members by a third by abolishing the Seanad and cutting the number of TDs by 20.,204,53520,201102
"In addition ministers’ salaries will be reduced, political expenses fully vouched for and severance payments for ministers axed.",303,53520,201102
No political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs and no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age.,303,53520,201102
"Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians. (See section 17)",202,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will hold a referendum on CONSTITUTION DAY within 12 months of assuming office at which the people will be asked to approve the abolition of the Seanad and other changes to the articles of the constitution covering the institutions of the state – principally the Executive, the Dáil, the Presidency and the Judiciary.",204,53520,201102
This referendum will not address the articles dealing with rights/social policy.,203,53520,201102
Fine Gael believes that an over-powerful Executive has turned the Dáil into an observer of the political process rather than a central player and that this must be changed.,204,53520,201102
Amend the constitution to give Dáil committees full powers of investigation.,204,53520,201102
"The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of Dáil committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.",204,53520,201102
Reduce the number of committees and give key committees constitutional standing.,204,53520,201102
"The Dáil needs fewer but stronger committees, resourced properly.",204,53520,201102
De-politicise their work.,204,53520,201102
"Chairs of committees will be assigned on a more proportional basis, while legislation will typically be introduced in a heads of Bill format to increase the chance of cross-party support.",204,53520,201102
Initiation of legislation and guillotines.,204,53520,201102
"We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills.",204,53520,201102
We will also tackle the huge over-use of guillotines to ram through non-emergency legislation.,204,53520,201102
Fine Gael believes there must also be a real shift in power from the state to the citizen.,201,53520,201102
Fine Gael has already published an Open Government Bill.,304,53520,201102
It will significantly strengthen Freedom of Information; establish a “whistleblowers charter”; register all lobbyists;,304,53520,201102
and create a new Electoral Commission.,202,53520,201102
"We will establish a Citizens Assembly, along the lines of those used in the Netherlands, to make recommendations on electoral reform.",202,53520,201102
We will also introduce a petitions system for the Dáil.,204,53520,201102
We will strengthen local government.,301,53520,201102
We will move many of the functions currently being performed by agencies back to Local Government,301,53520,201102
and ensure that all property-related revenues are part of the income stream of Local Government.,301,53520,201102
Fine Gael will reduce the voting age to 17 and give eligible citizens the right to vote at Irish embassies in the Presidential election.,204,53520,201102
If this experiment is deemed a success Fine Gael will consider extending this practice to general elections.,204,53520,201102
FairCare is the most ambitious plan for health reform since the establishment of the state.,504,53520,201102
"Longer waiting times, a record number of patients on A&E trolleys and huge hikes in insurance premiums all point to a system in desperate need of change.",504,53520,201102
FairCare will end Fianna Fail’s and Mary Harney’s privatisation strategy and address two key challenges:,504,53520,201102
High but Inefficient Spending: Between 1997 and 2009 spending on health more than quadrupled.,303,53520,201102
"While spending per capita is in line with Germany, France and Sweden, the 2009 Euro Health Index Consumer (EHIC) ranks Ireland only 24th for value for money.",305,53520,201102
The Netherlands is 4th in Europe as a whole and 1st in the original EU 15.,305,53520,201102
A Demographic Time-bomb: Our population is one of the youngest in Europe.,505,53520,201102
"Without reform, health spending, according to the VHI, will have to increase to €37 billion by 2020 to meet greater demand from an ageing population.",504,53520,201102
Ireland’s tax take now is only €33 billion!,505,53520,201102
"FairCare will gradually dismantle the HSE and replace it with a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI) starting in 2016, based on the very efficient Dutch model of healthcare.",303,53520,201102
Ireland will have a strong public health system in which the State guarantees equal access for all to quality healthcare with the insurance companies administering the system.,504,53520,201102
Once UHI is introduced the unfair and inefficient two-tier health system will be eliminated.,504,53520,201102
Every citizen will have private health insurance with the state paying for children/students and those on medical cards.,505,53520,201102
It will subsidise those with low income.,504,53520,201102
Public hospitals will remain under public ownership but will be given much more freedom to run themselves. (See section 13),504,53520,201102
Prior to the introduction of UHI Fine Gael will introduce a series of reforms to make the system more efficient and fairer.,503,53520,201102
This will allow us to minimise the impact of budget cuts on frontline services.,504,53520,201102
"Cost Savings: Fine Gael will reduce the headcount by 8,000 through natural retirement and a voluntary redundancy programme.",505,53520,201102
We will pay hospitals for the number of patients they treat rather than giving block grants (Money Follows the Patient) which will increase productivity by up to 10%.,303,53520,201102
We will accelerate the transfer of chronic disease management from hospitals to primary care.,504,53520,201102
This will save several hundred million once introduced and help fund the construction of more primary care centres throughout the country.,505,53520,201102
We will cut drugs costs further through various reforms.,505,53520,201102
"Driving towards free GP care for all: As part of our preparation for UHI, we will look at a number of ways to widen access to free GP care as finances permit, including increasing the number of people who have a GP Visit Card.",503,53520,201102
Fine Gael will also enter discussions with the insurers to see how cover for GP care can be extended by them to their clients at reasonable cost.,303,53520,201102
We will open up the General Medical Services (GMS) contract to all suitable qualified doctors to increase competition and reduce costs.,403,53520,201102
"Reduced Waiting Lists: We will establish a Special Delivery Unit (SDU), reporting directly to the Minister, to better manage waiting lists.",303,53520,201102
A similar approach in Northern Ireland significantly reduced waiting lists.,303,53520,201102
"A More Competitive Insurance Market: Fine Gael will introduce risk equalisation to make the system fairer, tackle the VHI’s dominant market position, and encourage new entrants into the market.",403,53520,201102
The agri-food sector has huge potential to contribute to export-led economic recovery.,703,53520,201102
"Agri-food exports are worth almost €8 billion sustaining over 150,000 jobs and 128,000 farms.",703,53520,201102
"But the agri-food industry has seen farming income fall by 40% between 2007 and 2009, three times more than the EU average.",703,53520,201102
"Farm incomes have recovered somewhat in the past year but the average still rests at approximately €16,500, significantly lower than the average industrial wage.",703,53520,201102
Fine Gael will provide agri-food businesses with the environment needed to position Ireland as a world leader in the food industry.,703,53520,201102
Fair Trade: Removing unfair practices which hinder competition will lower food prices for consumers and will give producers a fairer price for their produce.,703,53520,201102
"We will enact a Fair Trade Act, which will ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector such as ‘hello money’ which suppliers have to pay to get their goods on supermarket shelves.",703,53520,201102
"Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission: To save taxpayers’ money and to streamline resources, Fine Gael will merge the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency (NCA), Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) into a single, more powerful Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission.",303,53520,201102
We will seek to empower this new over-arching regulator and consumer champion to enforce our Fair Trade Act.,403,53520,201102
Farm Gate Schemes: Fine Gael recognises the contribution that farm gate schemes make to farm incomes and will do the utmost to protect farm-gate supports from further cuts.,703,53520,201102
AEOS: Fine Gael particularly values the contribution that agri-environment schemes play as an income support for farmers.,703,53520,201102
We will investigate the possibility of expanding the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) to those farmers locked out of the scheme following the conclusion of their REPS 3 contracts by delivering efficiencies within the current budgetary framework.,703,53520,201102
"CAP Reform: Fine Gael is committed to negotiating a fair deal for Irish farmers and will use our membership in the European People’s Party, the strongest political grouping in Europe, to campaign for a good deal for Ireland under the Common Agricultural Policy.",703,53520,201102
Our primary aim is to secure a fair overall budget for agriculture under the renegotiated CAP.,703,53520,201102
We will also prioritise a Single Farm Payment system which best benefits active farmers and the Irish system of production.,703,53520,201102
Trade Negotiations: Domestic economic problems must not overshadow emerging threats from ongoing trade negotiations.,703,53520,201102
Fine Gael will work with our partners in the European People’s Party to avoid any damage to the agricultural sector from future trade deals.,703,53520,201102
Market Volatility: We will negotiate a pragmatic approach in the EU to address the impact of volatility in commodity prices on producers.,703,53520,201102
"A More Efficient Department: The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has traditionally acted as a payment processing facility rather than a driver of growth in the agri-food industry.",303,53520,201102
We will move responsibility for agri-payments to a new one-stop-shop under our Reinventing Government proposals.,303,53520,201102
We will also develop a new innovation unit in the Department to drive new policy initiatives in the agrifood industry.,703,53520,201102

"Single Food Safety Agency: Building on the existing Food Safety Authority, Fine Gael will create a single food safety monitoring agency responsible for food safety inspection from farm to fork.",303,53520,201102
This will enhance the food traceability system and reduce the burden of red tape on business.,403,53520,201102
Food safety is paramount in maintaining Ireland’s reputation internationally as a producer of healthy food.,408,53520,201102
"However, there are currently too many different agencies involved in food safety including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, local authorities, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Services Executive and Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.",303,53520,201102
Reducing Labour Costs: Fine Gael will review Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) to deliver a more competitive environment for job creation in the agri-food sector.,703,53520,201102
We will allow farmers to negotiate a collective agreement at farm level with their staff which would exempt them from the ERO but not minimum wage and other employment protections.,703,53520,201102

Tax Commitments: Stock relief is an important benefit for young farmers at a time when other incentives and supports have been abolished.,703,53520,201102
We will maintain the existing relief.,703,53520,201102

Biomass: We will merge Coillte and Bord na Mona into a new company called Bioenergy and Forestry Ireland which will expand Ireland’s position in biomass.,501,53520,201102
This will not only create additional jobs for rural Ireland,703,53520,201102
but will also provide farmers with a very real market opportunity for renewable crops.,501,53520,201102
Anaerobic Digestion: We will develop a new agriculture energy and land use policy for the country and will investigate opportunities for anaerobic digestion as a means of producing electricity and providing an added income option for farmers.,703,53520,201102

"Expanding the Industry: Fine Gael believes Ireland, as an island nation with a strong and valued fishing tradition has huge potential to succeed as a serious competitor in the international seafood sector.",703,53520,201102
"The seafood industry currently generates annual revenues of €718 million and provides direct employment for 11,000 people.",703,53520,201102

Funding for Fisheries: Fianna Fáil and Green Party in-fighting has limited Ireland’s ability to draw down EU funds for seafood development.,305,53520,201102
We will resolve difficulties blocking the drawdown of available funds.,305,53520,201102
"Aquaculture Licensing: An additional 42 million tonnes of farmed seafood will be required to keep pace with demand each year by 2030, just 20 years away.",703,53520,201102
We must increase our raw material supply and expand our aquaculture sector.,703,53520,201102
We will remove administrative obstacles and clear the backlog of aquaculture licences currently preventing the creation of thousands of jobs in the aquaculture sector.,305,53520,201102
"Value Added Products: Currently, 85% of all Irish seafood is commodity traded.",703,53520,201102
There is a significant opportunity to generate more value from this raw material base.,703,53520,201102
Fine Gael will task Bord Iascaigh Mhara with assisting Irish companies in adding value to their products through innovation.,703,53520,201102

Marine Department: Marine and fisheries policy is currently spread across three Departments.,303,53520,201102

"National Marine and Coastal Plan: We will develop an integrated marine and coastal planning process to reach the full potential of our coastline in fishing, aquaculture, ocean energy",501,53520,201102
and tourism.,502,53520,201102

"Skills Development: We will encourage stronger linkages between Arts organisations and the business community to develop skills in fundraising, business planning and grasping sponsorship opportunities and networking opportunities.",502,53520,201102
We will build on existing initiatives such as the ‘New Stream’ programme which supports the creative industries through private investment in training and skills development.,411,53520,201102

Expanding the Irish Gaming Industry: Fine Gael will allocate funding from the Innovation Fund Ireland to Irish digital gaming start-ups.,411,53520,201102
"In the last seven years, jobs in the gaming industry have grown four-fold to 1,400 people.",411,53520,201102
Ireland must use its reputation as a technological leader to assist indigenous gaming companies to expand and develop new products and technology.,411,53520,201102
Commemorative Events: We will develop a cultural plan for future commemorative events such as the Centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.,601,53520,201102
UNESCO City of Literature: Ireland’s literary tradition and modern successes is one of the strongest selling points of the Arts industry.,502,53520,201102

Fine Gael is firmly committed to the continued development of sport in this country.,502,53520,201102
"At a time of economic difficulty, sporting events and successes are vital in lifting the country’s spirits and are a proud reflection of our nation’s potential for success.",502,53520,201102
We appreciate the important contribution that sport also makes to building a healthy nation.,502,53520,201102
"In Government, Fine Gael will promote greater participation in sport",502,53520,201102
and will provide the environment for our athletes to succeed on the international stage.,502,53520,201102
National Sports Audit: We will publish a National Sports Facility Audit to identify where gaps in sporting infrastructure exist.,411,53520,201102
This audit will inform any future investment on sports infrastructure.,411,53520,201102
Representative Bodies: We recognise the role of the various sporting organisations in developing high performance individual athletes and sporting participation at all levels across the country and,502,53520,201102
will ensure available funds are distributed fairly amongst those in most need of assistance.,503,53520,201102

and reaching out to under-represented groups and the unemployed.,705,53520,201102
Fine Gael will encourage and promote mass participation in sport.,502,53520,201102
"Cross Departmental Approach: We will ensure greater co-ordination and co-operation between the Departments of Sport, Health and Education so that issues like obesity and physical education in schools can be tackled in a structured way.",504,53520,201102
Special Olympics Ireland: We will support Special Olympics Ireland in furthering opportunities for people with learning disabilities to participate in high quality sport and development activities that bring life changing experiences of increased skills and self-confidence.,705,53520,201102
Banking is built on trust.,414,53520,201102
"But reckless lending by – and to – Irish banks during the property boom,",414,53520,201102
"encouraged by an irresponsible Government that put its election prospects over the stability of the Irish economy,",305,53520,201102
"means that Irish banks have lost the trust of depositors, investors and society at large.",414,53520,201102
And the response of the banks and the Government to the crisis has made matters worse.,305,53520,201102
Committing €100 billion of taxpayers’ money to the banks so that they can repay their foreign debts while starving the Irish economy of credit has made the recession far deeper than it needed to be.,410,53520,201102
"The current IMF-EU bail-out plan signed has not – and will not – restore confidence in Ireland, because at its heart is a commitment to continue the failed banking policies of the present Government.",109,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will make our banking system an engine of economic recovery by restoring public and market confidence in its financial health, management competence and ethical integrity.",414,53520,201102
"Re-negotiating the EU-IMF Programme of Support: Borrowing up to €25 billion in additional funds from the EU / IMF at 5.8% to cover additional bank losses from fire-sales of loans and other bank assets at rockbottom prices, as this Government has agreed, will push Irish Government debt towards unsustainable levels and hinder economic recovery, threatening the stability of the entire euro area.",109,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will seek a mandate from the Irish people to renegotiate a more credible, fairer package that is better for Ireland and Europe.",109,53520,201102
"A Transparent Assessment of the Capital Needs of Irish Banks: We will defer further recapitalisations of Irish banks until the completion of the Prudential Capital Assessment Review, which is expected to be available within weeks of the formation of a new Government.",414,53520,201102
It makes sense to know the size of the hole in the banks before committing further taxpayer resources.,414,53520,201102
This might also make it possible for the stronger banks to reduce the taxpayers’ exposure by raising private capital.,414,53520,201102
"European Support for Bank Recapitalisation: We will seek to re-negotiate the terms of reference of the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) and / or European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) to allow them to take equity stakes in systemically important European banks, such as AIB and Bank of Ireland.",108,53520,201102
A similar option is that Ireland could buy “insurance” from the EU against the risk that losses in Irish banks will be significantly greater than projected under the PCAR exercise.,414,53520,201102
Agreed Procedures for Restructuring the Debts of Troubled Banks: Fine Gael in Government will force certain classes of bond-holders to share in the cost of recapitalising troubled financial institutions.,414,53520,201102
"This will be done unilaterally for the most junior bondholders (owners of preference shares, sub-ordinated debt and similar instruments), but could be extended – as part of a European-wide framework – for senior debt, focusing on insolvent institutions like Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide that have no systemic importance.",401,53520,201102
A More Sustainable Funding Solution for Irish Banks: Irish banks need to shrink their balance sheets to reduce their dependence on volatile non-deposit funding sources.,414,53520,201102
We will seek to collaborate with U.S. regulatory authorities to collate the dollar assets of Irish banks (up to $50 billion) that could be used as security to secure funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve.,107,53520,201102
"Long-Term EU Funding for Irish Banks: Rather than selling assets at fire-sale prices with the losses covered by already over-stretched Irish taxpayers, we will negotiate with the EU/ECB to fund – on a longer-term basis – the transfer at par value of relatively-secure Irish bank loan books – such as tracker mortgages – into a “warehouse” or Special Purpose Vehicle.",408,53520,201102
This might involve the EU funds buying longterm bonds to fund such entities.,408,53520,201102
"This would shrink the Irish banks to a size where they can fund most of their remaining loan books through deposits, helping to address market concerns about their long-term liquidity position.",414,53520,201102
"Putting the Government Back in Charge of Restructuring the Banking Sector: We will establish and staff with the necessary expertise a new banking policy division in the Department of Finance to manage, from one central point, the efforts of the Central Bank, the NTMA and the banks’ management themselves to repair the Irish banking system.",303,53520,201102
Promoting New Leadership and Management in the Banks: A Fine Gael Government will accelerate the replacement of directors and senior managers in the Irish banks.,414,53520,201102
"To expedite this change-over we will openly construct a pool of globally experienced, turn-around managers and directors to be inserted into key executive and non-executive positions in banks receiving taxpayer support.",414,53520,201102
Banks Should Squeeze Their Costs before Their Customers: The cost-income ratios of AIB and Bank of Ireland are still out of line with comparable European banks.,414,53520,201102
A Fine Gael Government will direct any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present it with a plan within 100 days of coming into Office of how it intends to cut its wage bill and other costs – over and above existing plans – in a fair manner by a sufficient amount to forego a 25 basis point increase on their variable rate mortgages.,412,53520,201102
"This plan should include a new, lower pay cap for senior staff and a verifiable commitment to suspend all bonus payments until the banks are no longer in receipt of State support.",412,53520,201102
"Returning Viable Banks to Private Ownership: Fine Gael will complete the sale of EBS to a new, private owner, and will support the new institution as a lynchpin for building a third force in Irish banking to compete against AIB and Bank of Ireland in the business and personal banking markets.",414,53520,201102
"We will consider selling AIB to a large, foreign bank in order to bring access to new funding and capital for Irish enterprises,",414,53520,201102
and to address market concerns about the threat to the national finances from the banking system.,414,53520,201102
"We will seek to retain Bank of Ireland under domestic ownership and control,",414,53520,201102
"and will give individual Irish citizens an option to buy the State’s shares at a strike price that, at the very least, recovers the investment made by taxpayers.",401,53520,201102
Shutting Down Dead Banks: Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have no further role to play in the Irish economy.,412,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will wind up both institutions by the end of 2011, by transferring their remaining assets and deposits to other financial institutions or other asset recovery vehicles as appropriate.",412,53520,201102
Further losses incurred in this process will be shared with remaining bondholders.,401,53520,201102
A Healthy Credit Union Movement: Fine Gael recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions.,405,53520,201102
"In Government, we will establish a Commission to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus,",405,53520,201102
while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.,414,53520,201102
Mortgage Lending to First Time Buyers: The housing market will not be recover unless First Time Buyers have access to mortgage credit to enter the market.,403,53520,201102
"Working with the regulatory authorities and the industry, a Fine Gael Government will encourage new funding for Irish mortgage lending again by drawing a line under past practices and creating a new brand or status around the Irish mortgage market that puts the quality of Irish mortgages beyond any question in international markets.",403,53520,201102
"With this aim in mind, and drawing from best international practice, we will introduce new universal Mortgage Indemnity Insurance (‘negative equity insurance’) that provides security for prudent lenders and borrowers against future risks of negative equity.",403,53520,201102
Making Sure Banks Deliver on their Lending Promises: We will direct the new Credit Review Office to publish a delivery audit of the commitments by AIB and Bank of Ireland to make available a total of €12 billion in additional lending to small and medium enterprises in 2010 and 2011.,412,53520,201102
"A Partial Business Loan Guarantee to Support Job Creation: To get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs, a Fine Gael Government will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to the banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms.",402,53520,201102
"Micro Finance Start-Up Fund: Drawing from funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds, we will construct a €100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund which will provide start-up loans and equity to new businesses.",402,53520,201102
"Private not-for-profit organisations like First Step, Chambers of Commerce or Local Business Units in the City and County Councils could apply for capital from the Fund for investment in local start-ups, as part of a necessary move away from non-repayable grants.",402,53520,201102
"Financing for High-Tech, High-Potential Firms: We also support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by attracting top-tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, as recommended by the Report of the Innovation Taskforce.",402,53520,201102
"To begin, we will seek negotiations with Silicon Valley Bank to entice it to establish offices in Ireland.",402,53520,201102
We will also fix the regulatory problems to allow private pension funds to invest more in Irish business.,403,53520,201102
"Debt Responsibility: A Fine Gael Government will expect every family and every business to do everything possible to service their debts, and will not ask others to pay the debts of the reckless and dishonest.",414,53520,201102
A mass Government-imposed mortgage debt forgiveness scheme would close down new lending for First Time Buyers,414,53520,201102
and further raise interest rates for families on variable rate mortgages.,414,53520,201102
"Where, however, families and businesses have made best efforts and find themselves unable to service their debts, we will support them through the recession and help re-integrate them back into the economy.",504,53520,201102
"Helping Families in Mortgage Arrears: We will ensure that funding for the means-tested Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme can adequately cover families in need by capping the interest charged by lenders benefitting from this scheme at the ECB base rate plus 1%, or the contracted mortgage rate, whichever is lower.",504,53520,201102
"To improve uniformity of access and speed of processing applications, we will centralise its administration under our proposed single Payments and Entitlements Service.",303,53520,201102
"Banning Penalty Interest on Re-Structured Mortgages: We will legislate, if necessary, to stop mortgage lenders charging penalty interest rates (or forcing families to give up their low-cost tracker mortgage rates) on mortgages that have been rescheduled (i.e. the payment term lengthened) where the borrower has co-operated with the lender in agreeing a new, sustainable re-payment plan.",403,53520,201102
"Mortgage Interest Relief: We will increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers in 2004-08 (from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25% depending on the year the mortgage was taken out), financed in part by bringing forward the abolition of relief for new buyers from June 2011.",403,53520,201102
Deferred Interest: We will require banks in receipt of State support to give homeowners every chance to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage to avoid repossession during difficult times.,403,53520,201102
"For example, as recommended by the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group (November 2010), we will require all mortgage lenders to offer distressed home-owners a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) that enables borrowers who can pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest (but less than the full interest) to defer payment of the unpaid interest for up to five years.",403,53520,201102
"Trading Down: For some mortgage holders that are in negative equity, trading down would produce a reduction in mortgage debt and more affordable monthly payments.",408,53520,201102
We will work with the Financial Regulator and the industry to facilitate trading down and “negative equity mortgages” by borrowers in this situation.,403,53520,201102
Such options would have to be in the customers’ best interest.,403,53520,201102
"Using Pension Savings to Ease Debt Distress: Many middle-aged home-owners and / or owners of small businesses have generally-funded personal pension schemes, but are facing difficulties in servicing mortgages or other current financial obligations.",403,53520,201102

"A New Insolvency Regime for the Financially Responsible: Bar the most extreme cases, bankruptcy reflects the failure of the system.",408,53520,201102
"Where common sense is applied to most debtors’ circumstances, there is no need or point to making someone a bankrupt.",408,53520,201102
The sale of non-essential assets should be a part of any arrangement made between a debtor and their creditors.,408,53520,201102
Once the ability to provide for creditors from the income of the debtor through a Debt Settlement Agreement is taken into account and the proceeds from the sale non-essential assets are distributed there should be no need to go any further in most cases.,408,53520,201102
"But where this is not possible, Irish bankruptcy laws must be updated.",408,53520,201102
"They currently are unpractical, unused, excessively costly and overly penal.",408,53520,201102
"A Fine Gael Government will fast-track the reforms needed to bring us into line with best international standards,",408,53520,201102

"A Limited Residence and Personal Assets Safe Harbour that will permit a bankrupt to ring fence from the bankruptcy process ownership of a principal private residence (within limits based on size, value and family numbers) and specified personal assets not to exceed €40,000 in value;",408,53520,201102

A new Fine Gael Government will make a number of changes to the way NAMA works to help reduce taxpayer exposures and to kick-start the economy.,410,53520,201102
"Stopping Further Asset Transfers to NAMA: We do not believe that transferring the land and development loans of Irish banks of less than €20 million to NAMA is in the best interests of the Irish economy, and will seek a mandate from the Irish people to renegotiate this element of the Programme of Support from the IMF and EU.",410,53520,201102
"As an alternative, we will force Irish banks to take loss provisions against these loans similar to the haircuts that would have been applied by NAMA.",412,53520,201102
"This offers the advantage of forcing the banks to recognise their potential losses, as well as significant upside potential for new investors in Irish banks.",408,53520,201102
It also provides a more manageable administrative system for loans of this relatively small scale.,408,53520,201102
Kick-Starting the Property Market: Getting the property market functioning properly again is a condition of strong economic recovery.,410,53520,201102
This will require NAMA to dispose of property assets secured from developers in default of their loans into the private sector as quickly as possible.,410,53520,201102
"We are open to considering new types of investment vehicles – such as U.S. style Real Estate Investment Trusts – that can help create a new, liquid investment market in commercial property for Irish pension funds and smaller investors.",408,53520,201102
Reintroducing Diversity and Competition into the Property Market: We will force NAMA to outsource management of at least 70% of its assets to 3-4 competing private asset management companies.,403,53520,201102
Exposing NAMA to Public Scrutiny: A Fine Gael Government will strengthen the transparency of NAMA’s operations and its management of the assets paid for by the taxpayer.,303,53520,201102

"Higher, Loss Absorbing Bank Capital to Protect Taxpayers and Depositors: We will raise core equity capital requirements for systemically important banks on a permanent basis.",414,53520,201102
This will provide a greater buffer against banking losses before external intervention is required.,414,53520,201102
"To be counted as capital, “hybrid” debt instruments issued by Irish banks, such as sub-ordinated bonds, must include clear mechanisms for taking losses, either through write-downs or conversions into equity, without winding down the entire bank.",414,53520,201102
"Structural Reforms to Make Banking Safer: We will legislate, consistent with emerging EU frameworks in this area, to give the Financial Regulator additional “bank resolution powers” to take over and wind down banks that threaten financial stability, with losses being absorbed by investors and bond-holders before the taxpayer.",414,53520,201102
"Fine Gael will consider new legislation to separate more risky, speculative financial activities from the traditional banking activities of taking deposits and lending to enterprise.",414,53520,201102
Fine Gael will also intervene directly to stop banks from encouraging risky lending in the way they pay senior executives.,412,53520,201102
"Bank Levy / Dividends: As banks return to profitability and private ownership, we will target additional contributions from the sector to repay the Irish taxpayer for the cost of the bank bail-outs.",412,53520,201102

"Public Scrutiny of Audit Firms: To give the Oireachtas and the public confidence that auditors are doing their job properly, a Fine Gael Government will mandate the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (the independent regulator of the audit profession in Ireland) to publish their conclusions from their annual inspections of individual audit firms in respect of public interest entities.",303,53520,201102
"Shareholder Approval of Auditors: To emphasise the primacy of shareholders, in particular over management, in the appointment of auditors to financial institutions in receipts of State support, that audit committee chairpersons be required to propose at each AGM the appointment of the auditor and to set out their reasons for doing so.",414,53520,201102
We will also make it a standard practice that auditors should answer questions to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of public companies.,414,53520,201102
We will also require the audit committee of banks and other Public Interest Entities to evaluate the effectiveness and competence of the auditor every three years and set out for shareholders how they have done so.,414,53520,201102
Regulator Veto over Audit Appointments: For systemically important institutions (e.g. the banks) we will legislate to give the Financial Regulator a right of veto over the banks’ choice as auditor.,414,53520,201102

Consideration will be given to merging the gas network into Smart Grid as well.,411,53520,201102
SmartGrid will be tasked with accelerating the planned investments in our electricity networks needed to exploit greater levels of renewable power sources on a technology neutral basis.,411,53520,201102
"It will also be charged with giving Irish consumers greater control over their energy consumption, by allowing homes and farms with micro generators to sell excess energy back into the grid and with facilitating the roll out of electric cars.",411,53520,201102
"We will use the National Pension Reserve Fund, investments from public and private pension funds",411,53520,201102
and the proceeds of the sale of state assets to finance the investment through NewERA.,411,53520,201102
"We will sell nonstrategic assets such as Bord Gais Energy, ESB Powergen, and ESB Customer Supply.",411,53520,201102
"All strategic networks, distribution and hydro assets will be kept in majority state ownership, such as the gas pipelines and the electricity grid, and all sales will only take place when market conditions are amenable.",413,53520,201102
"Bio-Energy: We will merge Coillte and Bord na Mona to form a new commercial State company BioEnergy and Forestry Ireland to exploit Ireland’s natural advantage in biomass, engage in a 15,000ha per year afforestation programme",501,53520,201102
and to facilitate a roll out of combined heat and power technology.,411,53520,201102
"Lower Energy Prices: Fine Gael will set a target of reducing electricity prices to at or below the Eurozone average within 3 years by driving efficiencies in the energy companies, reforming the PSO/ReFIT subsidy system, increasing equity investment in new infrastructure through NewERA and reducing capacity payments.",402,53520,201102
Cheaper energy will be a vital cost competitiveness tool on the road to economic recovery.,410,53520,201102
Peat: Peat still plays an important role for heat requirements of many families and for Irish energy security.,501,53520,201102
"Recognising that a very conservative and restrictive interpretation of the Habitats Directive is now in force in Ireland, we will allow an exemption for domestic turf cutting on the 75 National Heritage Area sites, which are designated under Irish Law, subject to the introduction of an agreed environmentally national code of practice.",501,53520,201102
"In tandem with this, we will establish independent mediation between all relevant stakeholders with the specific objective of facilitating a resolution to the 55 SAC designated bogs.",501,53520,201102
"Furthermore, the independent mediation will be made available to resolve the outstanding issues associated with turf cutting on blanket bogs.",501,53520,201102
It is premature to cease the cutting of turf for domestic purposes in 2011 pending the establishment of the management structures and the appointment of an independent Chairperson.,501,53520,201102
We accept that peat will be phased out as a fuel for generating electricity over the next ten to fifteen years.,501,53520,201102
We will support the replacement of this fuel with biomass to retain jobs in the Midlands.,501,53520,201102
New Technologies: We will continue to fund research into ocean energy and will support one geothermal demonstration plant.,411,53520,201102
"Energy Planning: To keep down the cost of electricity, we ensure that future wind farms are built in locations where the wind regime is best and that they are built in large numbers or in clusters to reduce the cost of connection to the grid under a new ‘plan-led’ Gate 4 process as opposed to the existing ‘developer led’ system.",416,53520,201102
"PSO Levy: We will review and reform the PSO levy to ensure that only the most cost-effective projects are supported by a ReFIT tariff and that the consumer can benefit from a claw-back when market prices exceed the tariff or where appropriate, a share of the profits or a royalty.",403,53520,201102
"Rationalising Regulators: To save taxpayers’ money and to streamline resources, Fine Gael will merge the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency (NCA), Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) into a single, more powerful Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission.",303,53520,201102
"North-East Pylons: We will appoint an independent international expert commission to review and report, within six months, on the case for and cost of undergrounding all or part of the Meath-Tyrone 400KV power lines",415,53520,201102
"Micro Generation: We will provide a ReFIT for micro-generators wishing to produce electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and facilitate them selling surplus electricity to the grid.",403,53520,201102
"The tariff, however, will not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.",410,53520,201102
Electricity Interconnection: Fine Gael will explore the provision of an electricity interconnector with mainland Europe for security of supply.,411,53520,201102
Strategy for Import Disruption: Fine Gael will devise a contingency strategy for the allocation of energy resources in the event of a serious disruption of oil or gas supplies.,411,53520,201102
Recent climate emergencies highlighted the problems when Government does not have plans in place to deal with the unexpected.,416,53520,201102
"Investing in Next Generation Broadband: Fine Gael in Government will co-operate and co-invest with Eircom, UPC and other telecommunications companies to provide Next Generation Access (high-speed broadband) to every home and business in the State.",411,53520,201102
This will be achieved by delivering fibre to the home or kerb for 90% of homes and businesses in Ireland with the remaining 10% provided with high-speed mobile or satellite broadband.,411,53520,201102
"e-Government: Fine Gael will develop Ireland as a ‘Digital Island’ and will set tough targets to provide more Government services online such as all business services, planning applications, electoral register and driving licence applications.",411,53520,201102
We will set an ‘e-Day’ of January 1st 2016 for all these services to be available online.,411,53520,201102
TV Licence: We will change the TV Licence into a household-based Public Broadcasting Charge applied to all households and applicable businesses regardless of the device they use to access content.,502,53520,201102
"We will look a new ways of collection including the possibility of paying in instalments through another utility bill (electricity or telecom), collection by local authorities, the Revenue or a new contract with An Post.",502,53520,201102
This will reduce the cost of collection and widespread evasion and could yield a further €20m per annum.,303,53520,201102
TG4 will be funded from the charge by 2014.,502,53520,201102
Independent Broadcasting: We will increase the broadcasting fund from 7% to 15% over five years and will encourage more production companies and independent TV and Radio networks to bid for funding.,502,53520,201102
"Broadcast Levy: The Broadcast Levy imposed on television and radio stations to cover the costs of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) will be reduced as a consequence of the savings that will be made from the merger of the BAI and ComReg under the umbrella of a new Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission.",502,53520,201102
Digital Broadcasting: Fine Gael will ensure that digital switchover happens on time and that a vigorous public information campaign is carried out.,502,53520,201102
We will strengthen the powers of BAI (or its successor) to facilitate an agreement on a commercial multiplex.,502,53520,201102
Postal Services: We strongly support An Post as a state-owned company providing mail and other services.,413,53520,201102
"We will seek to expand the remit of post offices to include banking services, internet services and as a portal for government services to communities and business.",413,53520,201102
We will enact into law the Postal Services Bill which opens the postal market to competition.,403,53520,201102
"And will protect the universal service obligation (five day delivery to every home and business) by assigning it to An Post for at least twenty years, make provision for state subvention and require that any decision by ComReg to reassign or scrap the USO is subject to ministerial approval.",413,53520,201102
Postcodes: Fine Gael will introduce a new post code system that works on the principle of codes unique to the location of buildings as opposed to the Government’s current plan for an area code system.,303,53520,201102
Free to Air: We will maintain the current regime with regard to the Heineken Cup.,502,53520,201102
"Mine remediation: We will work with communities, the industry and stakeholders to ensure that closed mines are remediated and that responsibility for monitoring and managing closed mines can be taken over by the state after thirty years.",501,53520,201102
Oil and Gas: Exploiting Irish oil and gas reserves in Irish waters is important to maintaining security of supply and to providing much needed revenue.,501,53520,201102
We will incentivise and promote off-shore drilling and will streamline the planning and regulatory process for bringing ashore these reserves.,501,53520,201102
We explore the possibility of the Government taking an equity share in any new finds accepting that this will entail sharing in the investment costs as well as the profits.,501,53520,201102
The environment is vital not only for sustainable living but for economic recovery too.,416,53520,201102
With the right leadership we can enjoy a clean environment and a roaring economy.,416,53520,201102
Climate Change Legislation: Fine Gael will legislate for a climate change law that sets the Kyoto and EU2020 targets in national legislation but only on the basis of all party agreement.,501,53520,201102
Effects of Climate Change: In response to natural disasters such as flooding we will legislate to give the relevant line Minister temporary powers to take charge of the State’s actions under the guise of a National Emergency Response Action Committee.,501,53520,201102
"Investing in Clean, Green Infrastructure: Fine Gael’s NewERA plan will help transform Ireland into a low carbon and competitive economy by investing an extra €7 billion into new modern infrastructure in areas such as energy and broadband.",416,53520,201102
Electric Vehicles (EVs): We will incentivise consumers to switch to EVs by providing an ambitious roll out of electric transport charging points.,416,53520,201102
We will invite companies from the private and public sector to roll out these charging points.,416,53520,201102
We will commission a study into the feasibility of replacing government-owned vehicles with EVs.,416,53520,201102
"Carbon Tax: The €15 per tonne increase in the carbon tax to €30 per tonne proposed by Government for 2014 is excessive, and will be particularly hard felt by the elderly and in rural Ireland.",416,53520,201102
"With an increase of this scale, Ireland would likely have the highest carbon taxes in the world, making some energy-intensive industries uncompetitive here.",410,53520,201102
We will reduce the increase proposed in the Government’s 4-year plan by €5 per tonne (to €25 per tonne).,410,53520,201102
"An increase to solid fuels will be phased in only when progress is made to control imports of dirtier, more carbon–intensive solid fuels from the UK.",410,53520,201102
Fine Gael will provide an exemption from the additional carbon tax increases for agricultural diesel.,703,53520,201102
"Cutting Home Energy Use: We will double funding for home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes until the end of 2013, after which time these schemes will be ended.",416,53520,201102
Pre-announcing the closure of taxpayer-funded schemes will encourage homeowners to invest now and stimulate extra activity in this area,408,53520,201102
"and create an additional 5,000 jobs.",408,53520,201102
"After 2013, Fine Gael will roll out a ‘pay as you save’ scheme to continue home energy efficiency retrofitting work without recourse to public funding.",416,53520,201102
The Warmer Home Scheme will be protected.,416,53520,201102
Energy Efficient Public Buildings: We will tender for a ‘pay as you save’ contract to insulate all public buildings in the state.,416,53520,201102
The contractor will be expected to come up with the capital.,416,53520,201102
"This will be labour intensive, will save energy and reduce cost in the long run.",416,53520,201102
Bio-Energy in Buildings: We will reduce carbon emissions from energy hungry buildings by making combined heat and power generators the norm for large buildings.,501,53520,201102
"A new State company, Bioenergy & Forestry Ireland, will grow and market the biomass to feed a nationwide roll out of combined heat and power generator technology.",411,53520,201102
"Afforestation: Fine Gael will develop a new ambitious afforestation programme of 15,000 ha per annum as part of our NewERA strategy to feed the bio-energy production industry.",501,53520,201102
This is required to power the developing combined heat and power industry but also has the added advantage of acting as a ‘carbon sink’ to trap emissions.,501,53520,201102
Carbon Sinks: Fine Gael will push for organisations involved in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to be allowed to fund new forest carbon sinks in Ireland in lieu of purchasing foreign carbon credits.,501,53520,201102
High Speed Broadband: We will reduce emissions from transport by developing dependable high speed broadband to allow more teleconferencing and shared digital information.,501,53520,201102
Waste Competition and Regulation: We will offer better waste services and choices to residents by fostering greater competition in the waste market.,501,53520,201102
Local Authorities will become a waste operator ‘as a last resort’.,501,53520,201102
"The sector will be subject to independent regulation by the new Competition, Consumer and Utilities Commission.",403,53520,201102
National Waste Policy: Fine Gael will develop a single National Waste Strategy incorporating regional waste plans.,404,53520,201102
"We must attract investment in waste infrastructure in a way that maximises potential economies of scale, competition",411,53520,201102
and enables the market to pass on the benefits to businesses and households.,403,53520,201102
Ireland will only meet stringent EU targets on environmentally sustainable waste disposal via a coordinated and planned approach by Government.,501,53520,201102
"Recycling: We will continue to develop recycling services such as brown, green and grey wheelie bins in order to facilitate waste segregation and recycling.",501,53520,201102

Zero Tolerance Litter: Fine Gael will take a tough approach with those who litter our communities.,501,53520,201102
We will increase fines and adopt zero tolerance for people found fly tipping in order to protect our natural environment.,501,53520,201102
"Waste Tax: We will introduce an environmental tax on packaging, as recommended by Comhar.",501,53520,201102
Delivering Water: Fine Gael will deliver clean and reliable drinking water in all parts of the country by creating a single water utility company to take over responsibility of water from the fragmented local authorities that will use new investment and best practice to deliver better water services.,411,53520,201102
Water Charging: Fine Gael will introduce a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.,501,53520,201102
We will not ask home owners to pay for a broken and unreliable system and that is why Fine Gael will only introduce water charging after the establishment of a new State owned water utility company to take over responsibility from the separate local authorities for Ireland’s water infrastructure and to drive new investment.,413,53520,201102
Septic Tanks: Fine Gael will tackle leaking septic tanks that pollute our groundwater.,501,53520,201102
We will introduce new regulations and standards to address the serious problems associated with septic tanks.,501,53520,201102
As part of our Home Improvement Scheme we will provide short term finance for septic tank remediation assistance for home owners.,501,53520,201102
Noise pollution: Fine Gael will introduce new laws to deal with the nuisance of intrusive noise.,501,53520,201102

Fine Gael’s key foreign affairs priority is to work towards the building of ever-stronger links between North and South and towards the removal of any threat to peace from dissident groups.,106,53520,201102
"We will continue to work with our Northern counterparts to realise the full economic, cultural and social potential of this island.",106,53520,201102
The European Union was vital in our economic development over the past three decades and will now play a critical role in our recovery through access to funds and markets.,108,53520,201102
We must ensure we maintain strong representation at EU level to promote Irish employment and Irish citizens’ interests.,108,53520,201102
"Abroad, we will make our Agencies and Embassies work hard to bring trade, tourists and talent to Ireland supporting a return to a thriving economy.",107,53520,201102
Good Friday Agreement: Fine Gael supports the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.,106,53520,201102
We will work to ensure closer links between North and South that are respectful of both communities.,106,53520,201102
"St. Andrew’s Agreement: We are committed to publishing the review of the North-South Implementation Bodies and Areas for Co-operation, as provided for in the St Andrews Agreement, to recognise work that has been carried out and to build on successes.",101,53520,201102
"New areas for co-operation, currently under review, should also be identified as set out in the Agreement.",106,53520,201102
"Economic Co-operation: We will continue to forge closer links in research and development, trade, investment and enterprise to help speed up the process of economic recovery on the island.",101,53520,201102
"We will also support enhanced co-operation and co-ordination in the provision of key infrastructure on the island of Ireland, including energy, transport and telecommunications.",101,53520,201102
"Border Economic Plan: We will propose the preparation, in partnership with the British government, of a joint economic plan for the border regions in both jurisdictions.",101,53520,201102
Fine Gael has already established a Border Forum to develop new policy initiatives designed to capitalise on the potential of this region.,101,53520,201102
Dissident Groups: We will ensure An Garda Siochana have the necessary resources to monitor the activities of dissident groups in this State.,605,53520,201102
A concentrated effort to disrupt their recruitment methods and other activities will reduce the risk of further atrocities by these groups.,605,53520,201102
Fine Gael sees our membership of the European Union as the cornerstone of our economic recovery.,108,53520,201102
We firmly believe that remaining a central member of the EU is essential for attracting inward investment and for access to markets.,108,53520,201102
We are determined to restore Ireland’s position as a respected and influential part of the European family,108,53520,201102
and to undo the damage done to our reputation by the outgoing Government.,305,53520,201102
A key priority for Enda Kenny as Taoiseach will be to lead a major diplomatic effort to repair our relationships with our European partners and institutions.,108,53520,201102
"We will use our role in the European People’s Party, the strongest political grouping in the EU, and Enda Kenny’s senior position of Vice-President of the EPP, to further this cause.",108,53520,201102
"Re-negotiating the EU-IMF Programme of Support: Borrowing up to €25 billion in additional funds from the EU/IMF at 5.8% to cover additional bank losses from fire-sales of loans and other bank assets at rockbottom prices, as this Government has agreed, will push Irish Government debt towards unsustainable levels and hinder economic recovery, threatening the stability of the entire euro area.",109,53520,201102
A Fine Gael Government will not make Irish taxpayers borrow at such penal interest rates to pay for a firesale of Irish bank assets.,305,53520,201102
"We will seek a mandate from the Irish people to renegotiate a more credible, fairer package that is better for Ireland and Europe.",109,53520,201102
"European People’s Party: As a member of the European People’s Party, Europe’s largest political grouping, Fine Gael fully supports greater EU co-operation and integration on issues of mutual concern, particularly the current economic crisis.",108,53520,201102
"An Irish role in EU Judicial and Home Affairs Cooperation: We believe that Ireland should be fully involved in the fight against international crime, especially as there is increasing evidence of this country being used as a route to import illegal drugs into Europe.",108,53520,201102
The result of this new crime threat can be seen in the violent gangland conflicts in our major cities.,605,53520,201102
Security and Defence: Fine Gael wants Ireland to get involved in the construction of a new European security system at an early stage so that we can join and influence it on our terms.,104,53520,201102
We want any EU common security and defence system to be guided by five key principles:,104,53520,201102
The commitment to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations (UN);,107,53520,201102
"The commitment to the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and a promise never to use either type of weapon;",105,53520,201102
The commitment to providing peacekeeping and peacemaking operations;,106,53520,201102
"The commitment to respect the right of other EU States to enter other military alliances, or to be neutral, as they choose.",108,53520,201102
The right of Ireland to opt-in and opt-out of aspects of a mutual defence and security system on a caseby-case basis.,107,53520,201102
Remove the Triple Lock: We believe that the Triple Lock must be modified to allow Ireland participate in peacekeeping missions.,106,53520,201102
The failure of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution should not prevent us from taking part in EU humanitarian and overseas missions.,109,53520,201102
"We believe that Irish troops should be capable at short notice, if requested, to assist in emergency relief efforts at times of humanitarian crises.",104,53520,201102
Enlargement: We will support carefully planned European Union enlargement.,108,53520,201102
We reaffirm that all applicant countries must meet the criteria for accession in full.,108,53520,201102
We believe that all applicant countries must recognise each of the current members of the European Union.,108,53520,201102
Taxation: We will oppose any attempt to dilute the unanimity requirement for tax harmonisation.,110,53520,201102
"Implementation of EU law: We will commission an independent audit into the transposition and implementation of EU law,",110,53520,201102
particularly focusing on legislation which has caused concern or been deemed burdensome to business administration activities.,303,53520,201102
"Ireland’s Diplomatic network: We will ensure Ireland’s Embassies play a key role in both helping to win inward investment and in supporting the work of Enterprise Ireland and IDA for economic purposes, focusing particularly on emerging economies.",107,53520,201102
We will also establish ‘educational attaché’ roles within Embassies in key markets to work with educational stakeholders and provide information about Ireland as an international education destination.,506,53520,201102

"Irish Emigrants: We will establish an Executive Office for the Irish Abroad within the Department of Foreign Affairs that will deal with the needs of Irish Emigrants in the UK, USA and young emigrants leaving Ireland today.",705,53520,201102
This new Office will ensure that Irish people who emigrate in the current climate are properly prepared to live independently in different societies.,705,53520,201102
"Undocumented Irish: We will campaign for a more effective visa agreement with the United States, to provide Irish and American citizens with the opportunity to live and work in both countries.",107,53520,201102
We will also use every opportunity available to push for the development of a bilateral agreement with the U.S. to regularise the status of the many undocumented Irish living in America.,107,53520,201102
"Terrorism: We will work with both our European Union colleagues to combat terrorism and the threat posed by extremism, without engaging in, or supporting directly or indirectly, methods or operations which compromise our respect for human rights.",108,53520,201102
UN Decision Making Reform: We support reforms of the United Nations that enhance decision-making processes and representation at the U.N.,107,53520,201102
Fine Gael also supports the view that the European Union should have stronger voice at a reformed UN Security Council.,108,53520,201102
Middle East: We will assert the European Union as a key player in the Middle East peace process.,108,53520,201102
We believe the EU could take a more active role and offer peacekeeping troops to support the crossing points around Gaza in an effort to restart peace talks.,106,53520,201102
"Overseas Development Aid: As we resolve our budget crisis, Fine Gael will place a renewed focus on and approach to meeting the U.N’s Millennium Development Goals.",107,53520,201102
We will review the implementation of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid with a view to addressing shortcomings and to build on successes.,107,53520,201102
"We will establish a Civilian Corps, which could include job seekers to use and share their skills in developing countries while retaining job seekers benefit.",107,53520,201102
We will also restructure the Irish Aid Programme to ensure stricter funding criteria and to introduce a quality standard mark for aid delivery in Programme countries.,107,53520,201102
We will use the leverage that Ireland gains through our aid programme to encourage and support democratic development and respect for human rights in the countries of the developing world.,107,53520,201102
We will support partner Governments and civil societies in their fight against corruption.,107,53520,201102
"Emergency Humanitarian Assistance: In times of humanitarian crises, we will unite NGOs that provide humanitarian aid to create a single appeals mechanism for national fundraising and public response.",107,53520,201102
"This will maximise publicity for the cause, the receipt of emergency funds and ensure the effective and co-ordinated dispersal of emergency aid.",107,53520,201102
The State will financially support these NGOs in their response.,107,53520,201102
Ireland’s Defence Forces have a proud record in international peacekeeping.,106,53520,201102
"We believe that Irish troops should be deployed, if requested, to assist in emergency relief efforts at times of humanitarian crises.",106,53520,201102
A Transformed Passport Service: We will transform the loss making Passport Service into an independent Executive Agency that will be self-financing and will have much greater degrees of managerial autonomy.,303,53520,201102
"It will be able to make investments in equipment, develop online application processes, provide a swift and reliable service and will have greater accountability to Parliament.",303,53520,201102
Preventing Passport Abuse: We will introduce security measures to prevent any further international abuses of the Irish passport.,303,53520,201102
"We will also introduce new procedures, including interviews or financial penalties, for the loss of an Irish passport.",303,53520,201102
"In 2009, over 34,000 Irish passports were lost or stolen.",303,53520,201102

"It is designed to reduce costs,",505,53520,201102
increase access and make the system much fairer.,503,53520,201102
"It will dismantle the dysfunctional Health Service Executive (HSE) that was created by Micheál Martin in 2004,",305,53520,201102
and end the efforts of Fianna Fail and Mary Harney to privatise the health system by favouring private over public care.,504,53520,201102
"Our ultimate goal is to establish a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI), based on the very efficient Dutch model – but adapted to Irish circumstances.",504,53520,201102
"The underlying philosophy is that the patient should be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely and efficient.",504,53520,201102
Once UHI is introduced the unfair and inefficient two-tier health system will be eliminated.,504,53520,201102
Patient will be treated on the basis of medical need – not on the basis of how much money they have.,504,53520,201102
"There will be one strong public health system, where the state guarantees the level of service and quality and competing insurance companies are responsible for much of its administration.",504,53520,201102
"Fine Gael believes it will take up to ten years to fully reform the health system and, as result, our programme for change is divided into two parts.",504,53520,201102
"Treating More Patients in the Community: This reform will allow an increasing number of patients, especially those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, stroke and asthma, to be treated near or at their homes and will save the health service several hundred million euro annually once fully introduced.",504,53520,201102
"This increased patient flow will, in turn, provide GPs with the incentives and resources to expand their services.",504,53520,201102
Fine Gael will see to it that a network of purpose built Primary Care Centres is delivered by the end of our first term in Government.,504,53520,201102
"These new centres will cater both for chronically ill patients as well as patients needing X-rays, blood tests or treatment for minor accidents or illnesses.",504,53520,201102
"Reducing Waiting Lists: We will establish a Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the Department of Health, reporting directly to the Minister to eliminate existing long waiting times.",504,53520,201102
"The SDU’s role will be to ensure that targets are met, and to act as a source of expertise for healthcare professionals and managers.",504,53520,201102
Key personnel may need to be seconded from other health care systems that have successfully reduced waiting lists.,504,53520,201102
A similar-type system in Northern Ireland reduced waiting times significantly over four years with little or no additional money.,504,53520,201102
"Increasing Productivity by Changing the Way Hospitals are Paid: We will pay hospitals for the number of patients they treat rather than, as is currently the case, giving them block grants.",504,53520,201102
"This system, which is known as Money Follows the Patient, should increase hospital productivity by between 5% and 10% and will make the system much more transparent and accountable.",504,53520,201102
"Driving towards Free GP Care for All: As part of our preparation for UHI, which will gradually deliver Free GP Care for all, we will look at a number of ways to widen access to free GP care as finances permit, including increasing the number of people who have a GP Visit Card.",504,53520,201102
Fine Gael will also enter discussions with the insurers to see how cover for GP care can be extended by them to their clients at reasonable cost.,504,53520,201102
We will open up the General Medical Services (GMS) contract to all suitable qualified doctors to increase competition and reduce costs.,504,53520,201102
"Using Information Technology (IT) to Cut Costs: We have looked at how other health systems, such as Sao Paolo in Brazil and the Veterans Administration in the US, have significantly increased efficiency through the proper use of IT.",504,53520,201102
Fine Gael will establish a separate IT agency for all of the public sector which will work directly with the SDU in order to ensure that projects are implemented on time and on budget.,504,53520,201102
The HSE’s track-record on IT to date is very poor.,504,53520,201102
"Ending Co-location: More than five years since the announcement of Minister Harney’s co-location plan, not one of the promised beds has been put in place.",504,53520,201102
Fine Gael will end the Government’s efforts to make the two-tier system even more unfair by allowing private hospitals to develop on the lands of public hospitals.,504,53520,201102
Protecting A&E: No A&E services will be withdrawn unless a demonstrably better service is put in place and is seen to work.,504,53520,201102
Reforming the Insurance Market: We will introduce a system of risk equalisation to ensure that the Irish insurance market works more effectively.,504,53520,201102
"UHI – Changing the Role of the State in Healthcare Delivery: Under UHI every citizen will have health insurance from one of a number of competing insurance companies, which will provide equal access to a comprehensive range of hospital and medical services.",504,53520,201102
The insurance companies will take over much of the burden of administering the system.,504,53520,201102
Pay for children/students and those on medical cards (and their families).,504,53520,201102
It will also subsidise those on low income,503,53520,201102
"Require all insurance companies to offer a standard package of health insurance that will cover all key service such as hospital care, GP care, maternity care, etc.",403,53520,201102
"A system of Community Rating will be introduced which will ensure that no insurance company can discriminate on the basis of age, sex or health status, and",403,53520,201102
"Be responsible for regulating the system, ensuring that safety and quality are maintained, and funding services that are not covered through UHI such as long term care, mental health, disease prevention, etc.",403,53520,201102
Public hospitals will remain under public ownership but will be given much more freedom to run themselves,301,53520,201102
FairCare will split the HSE into two before the introduction of UHI:,303,53520,201102
"A Healthcare Commissioning Authority (HCA) for the acquisition of “cure services” – hospital care, GP care, etc.",504,53520,201102
"A Care Services Authority (CSA) for the acquisition and provision of “care services” for the elderly, disabled, children, etc.",504,53520,201102
Once UHI is introduced the HCA will cease to function and the majority of the people it employs will instead be employed directly by the hospitals.,504,53520,201102
Professionals whose work is not directly related to hospitals will have their employment contracts switched to the CSA.,504,53520,201102
"Fairness and respect for employment conditions will be central to this transition, and will be negotiated with trade unions.",701,53520,201102
Opening Up the Insurance Market: UHI will double the size of the health insurance market.,403,53520,201102
"This will attract new entrants, increasing competition and choice for customers.",403,53520,201102
Reforming the VHI: Fine Gael believes that the VHI can provide a “public option” for customers once UHI is introduced.,504,53520,201102
"However, we believe it should be slimmed down considerably so that it no longer has a dominant market position.",504,53520,201102
"Giving Local Hospitals More Control: Under FairCare individual or networks of hospitals will be managed by hospital trusts, where patients, staff and members of the local community have a real say in the services delivered and in the development of the hospital.",301,53520,201102
Gradually Introduce Free GP Care for All once UHI is established: Once UHI has been fully implemented Free GP Care will be available to everyone and the two-tier system will end.,504,53520,201102
FairCare’s cost reduction programme will protect front line services as much as possible even as we see reductions in the health budget as a result of the fiscal crisis.,504,53520,201102
"Reducing Bureaucracy: Fine Gael will reduce HSE staff numbers by 8,000 by 2014 through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary redundancies.",504,53520,201102
Compulsory redundancy will therefore not be required.,701,53520,201102
"Cutting Waste and Inefficiency: Significant savings will be found by reducing the cost of agency staff, taxis, absenteeism and non-core pay such as overtime and allowances for example.",303,53520,201102
Cutting the Cost of Drugs: Fine Gael will introduce Reference Pricing and reduce the cost of generic medicines in order to make savings to the State drugs bill.,505,53520,201102
Private patients will benefit from cheaper medicines in their local pharmacies.,504,53520,201102
Fine Gael will improve efficiency by 5-10% by introduce Money Follows the Patient.,303,53520,201102
Fine Gael will cut costs by transferring chronic disease management from hospitals to primary care.,504,53520,201102
Home Supports: We will ensure that the eligibility criteria for the home help and the Home Care Package Schemes are applied fairly and consistently across the country.,504,53520,201102
"Nursing Home Support Scheme: Fine Gael will seek to address the anomalies in the Nursing Home Support Scheme such as the level of care services available under the Scheme, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and chiropody for example.",504,53520,201102
We will also provide clarification around the definition of a “sudden illness” for the application of the three-year cap to farms and small businesses.,504,53520,201102
Caring for Carers: Fine Gael appreciates the important contribution carers make to society and the fundamental role they play in supporting people at home.,705,53520,201102

"Personal Budgets: By the end of our first term in Government, Fine Gael will give people with disabilities the option of “Personal Care Budgets” so that they can choose the services that meet their individual needs.",201,53520,201102
Personal budgets introduce greater transparency in funding and improved targeting of resources.,504,53520,201102
"End-of-Life & Palliative Care: Fine Gael will improve end-of-life and palliative care services by promoting better collaboration between health and social service providers,",504,53520,201102

"As a result of the jobs crisis, the ESRI forecast an additional 100,000 emigrants in the next two years – a higher rate of emigration than occurred even during the depths of the recession in the 1980s.",701,53520,201102
The Government’s response to the crisis has made matters worse.,305,53520,201102
Fiscal austerity to pay for massive bank bail-outs has not restored confidence and employment in the Irish economy.,305,53520,201102
"Unlike this Government, Fine Gael understands that we cannot fix either the fiscal or banking crises without also fixing the jobs crisis.",408,53520,201102
"The ESRI believes that Ireland has the capacity to generate a net increase of 100,000 jobs over the next five years.",408,53520,201102

"We will not increase direct rates of tax on income, company profits, employment and enterprise investment,",402,53520,201102

Employers’ PRSI: There will be no increased tax on employment such as employers PRSI which can be as high at 10.75%.,402,53520,201102

"Extra Investment in Key Networks: As we fix the deficit in a way that restores confidence, a Fine Gael Government will use the remaining funds in the NPRF, sell non-strategic state assets and restructure the commercial semi-state sector in order to finance €7 billion in extra investment in water services, telecommunications and energy.",411,53520,201102
"This will support demand and employment in the short-term, and provide the basis for sustainable, export-led jobs and growth for the next generation.",410,53520,201102
"These will be profitable, commercial investments, repaid by charges on users, businesses and consumers.",410,53520,201102

A ‘Bord Snip” for the Semi-States: We will also appoint a committee to examine the accounts and cost base of the semi-states – a ‘Bord Snip’ for the semi-states – to recommend ways to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in each company with a view to passing on any savings to customers.,413,53520,201102
‘Home to Export’ Programmes: A new ‘Home to Export’ programme will be established to share the expertise of exporting companies with firms currently reliant on declining domestic markets.,407,53520,201102
A ‘Source Ireland’ portal will be developed to market Irish goods and services abroad.,407,53520,201102

"The Digital Gaming Industry: The rise of casual gaming, apps and smart phones have revolutionised digital gaming design.",411,53520,201102

"A New Department of Jobs and Economic Planning: In order to enhance political and administrative attention across Government on pro-employment, pro-competitiveness enterprise and regulatory policies needed for economic recovery, we will merge Forfás into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to create a new Department of Jobs and Economic Planning",303,53520,201102
A Dedicated Minister of State for Competitiveness: Continuing to supporting the Department and the Minister will be the National Competitiveness Council (NCC).,410,53520,201102

Fine Gael will restore power to Local Government.,301,53520,201102
"Recognising the disconnect between local authorities, councillors and their respective communities Fine Gael will empower local authorities to solve problems at a local level.",301,53520,201102
"Restoring Power to Local Level: We will confront the traditional, centralised top down approach to delivery and responsibility of local services by transferring powers and services from unelected Quangos to Local Authorities in areas such as job and housing supports.",301,53520,201102
By doing so we intend to make local authorities more relevant to the communities they serve and to give people a say in how local services are provided.,301,53520,201102
"Promoting Local Job Creation: Fine Gael will merge the local enterprise and job support functions of local, regional and national agencies into a single business and enterprise unit within Local Authorities.",301,53520,201102
"This will allow the streamlining of local job creation and support functions, increased shared knowledge capability and resources while saving on administration costs.",303,53520,201102
Directly Elected Mayor for Dublin: We support the concept of a directly elected Mayor for Dublin but reforms of local government are firstly required to avoid additional costs and bureaucracy.,301,53520,201102
Fine Gael will implement these reforms before creating a directly elected Mayor for Dublin in 2014 to co-incide with the local elections.,301,53520,201102
Efficient Local Government: Fine Gael will reduce wasteful spending and cut back the bloated structures of politics and public administration built up over the last decade.,303,53520,201102

Home Improvement Scheme: We will double funding for home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes until end 2013.,416,53520,201102
"Pre-announcing the closure of taxpayer funded schemes will encourage homeowners to invest now and stimulate extra activity in this area and create an additional 5,000 jobs.",409,53520,201102
We will also temporarily expand this scheme to include septic tank remediation assistance and radon gas prevention products to protect public health.,501,53520,201102
Fine Gael will roll out a ‘pay as you save’ scheme post 2013 to continue home energy efficiency retrofitting work without recourse to public funding.,501,53520,201102
"Family Home Repossessions: Fine Gael will increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers in 2004-08 (from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25% depending on the year the mortgage was taken out), financed in part by bringing forward the abolition of relief for new buyers from June 2011.",412,53520,201102
Fine Gael is also fully supportive of new guidelines to compel banks to give homeowners every chance to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage to avoid repossession during difficult times.,412,53520,201102
"Funding Local Government: Fianna Fail’s proposal, now endorsed by the Labour Party, to introduce by 2014 an annual, recurring residential property tax on the family home is unfair.",305,53520,201102
"But as we tackle the fiscal crisis, we will have to cut central exchequer funding for local authorities,",301,53520,201102
and we recognise that local authorities will have to find more sustainable sources of revenue appropriate to local circumstances.,301,53520,201102
What will be viewed as fair in South Dublin might be viewed as unworkable in rural Clare.,301,53520,201102
"In this context, we will empower local authorities to put in place, following the 2014 local elections, fairer alternatives to Fianna Fail’s and Labour’s recurring annual tax on the family home.",301,53520,201102
"No extra local taxes, forcing local authorities to close non-priority services and / or to deliver increased efficiencies;",301,53520,201102
Increased local user charges for waste etc.; or,301,53520,201102
"The option of a local “site sale profits tax”. Such a tax would be levied on the profit made from the site value on the sale of a residence (sales proceeds, less cost indexed by inflation, less stamp duty paid and less home improvements)",301,53520,201102
The final measure might be considered as both fairer and more economically sensible than an annual recurring property tax.,408,53520,201102
"Whichever option local electorates choose, for the first time since the 1970s local government will have real independence from central government in deciding what services to provide at local level and how to fund them.",301,53520,201102
Social Housing: Fine Gael will use the additional funding allocated in our Home Improvement Scheme to improve the energy efficiency of older local authority social housing.,416,53520,201102

Homelessness: Fine Gael is committed to ending long term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.,705,53520,201102
"We firmly believe that prevention is better than cure and in Government we will aggressively target the root causes of homelessness, as in the long term it will be a more effective way to prevent homelessness.",705,53520,201102
A key part of Fine Gael’s public service reform strategy is to invest now to reduce future demand for services.,705,53520,201102
"By having a dedicated body to coordinate policy across Government we can target initiatives in cross cutting areas such as education, health care, and housing which will aim to prevent as much as possible problems like homelessness, child poverty and other avoidable problems caused by lack of joined up action.",705,53520,201102
"To address the issue of existing homelessness we will review and update the existing Homeless Strategy, including a specific focus on youth homelessness,",705,53520,201102
and take into account the current demands on existing housing and health services with a view to assessing how to best provide additional services.,504,53520,201102
Ghost Estates: We will create tough penalties for developers that leave unfinished ghost estates and those in breach of planning permission.,416,53520,201102
"In addition, within six months of entering Government we will compel all local authorities to produce an action plan on how they intend to deal with each ghost estate in their locality.",416,53520,201102
We will also completely overhaul the system of planning development bonds to ensure greater conditionality is placed on developers to finish projects to reduce the exposure of local planning authorities to unfinished developments.,301,53520,201102
"Planning Co-ordination: Fine Gael will seek to better coordinate national, regional and local planning laws in order to achieve better and more coordinated development that supports local communities instead of the current system that favours developer led planning.",302,53520,201102
"Anti-Social Hotspots: Fine Gael will target bad planning and anti social hotspots by developing a ‘Good Practice Guide’ for planners and developers to make housing developments, streets and parks safer, better places.",416,53520,201102
The aim will be to draw attention to crime prevention principles which has been lacking in many modern high density housing areas.,605,53520,201102
Local Transport: We will improve local transport access by making local transport plans an integral part of local Development Plans.,411,53520,201102
"We will force all local authorities to develop a transport plan in conjunction with their County/City Development Plans, and Local Areas Plans.",411,53520,201102
A transport plan must make provision for transport infrastructure and state clearly how local communities can access public transport.,411,53520,201102
Urban Centres: Fine Gael will create proper urban centres for the benefit of local communities by creating new guidelines for urban and village centres so that we can renew and rediscover the concept of having a genuine public space as the nucleus of any neighbourhood.,416,53520,201102
Fine Gael’s New Politics is the most ambitious programme for political reform since the 1930s.,204,53520,201102
"We believe that a broken system of government and politics, which Fianna Fail manipulated for its own electoral advantage,",305,53520,201102
is at the heart of Ireland’s economic collapse.,204,53520,201102
In any Republic the people are supposed to be supreme -judged by that standard Ireland today is a Republic in name only.,202,53520,201102
"The expressions “Golden Circle”, “Crony Government” and “Crony Capitalism” all describe the same thing:",202,53520,201102
"The abduction of our Republic by both public and private sector vested interests, aided and abetted by Fianna Fail.",202,53520,201102
Reclaiming the Republic: Fine Gael wants to reclaim Ireland from the vested interests which have done such terrible damage to our nation.,202,53520,201102
We want to build a new Republic in which the interest of the people and not those of the insiders are placed at the centre of politics in Ireland -in so doing we will be guided by three key principles:,202,53520,201102
Change must start at the top: The political system cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if it is not prepared to do the same.,303,53520,201102
"Fine Gael will cut the size of the Oireachtas by one-third by abolishing the Seanad, if the public approve in constitutional referendum, and cutting the number of TDs by 20.",204,53520,201102
"In addition ministers’ salaries will be reduced, political expenses fully vouched for and severance payments for ministers axed.",303,53520,201102
No political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs and no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age.,303,53520,201102
"Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians.",202,53520,201102
Change must be fundamental and comprehensive: Modern Ireland cannot be governed by a system of government originally designed for 19th Century Britain.,204,53520,201102
Ireland needs more than piecemeal reform.,204,53520,201102
It needs radical root and branch change.,204,53520,201102
Change must involve the citizens: The people must be consulted on and involved in the process of political reform.,202,53520,201102
"That is why we will establish a Citizens Assembly, along the lines of that used in the Netherlands to make recommendations on electoral reform.",202,53520,201102
It will be composed of up to a 100 members who will be chosen from the public to reflect the demographic make-up of the country.,202,53520,201102
"Constitution Day: A Fine Gael Government will also hold a referendum on CONSTITUTION DAY within 12 months of assuming office at which the people will be asked to approve the abolition of the Seanad and other changes to the articles of the constitution covering the institutions of the State – principally the Executive, the Dáil, the Presidency and the Judiciary.",204,53520,201102
This referendum will not address the articles dealing with rights/social policy as we want the focus to stay on political reform.,203,53520,201102
A Stronger Parliament Holding Government to Account: Fine Gael believes that an over-powerful Executive has turned the Dáil into an observer of the political process rather than a central player and that this must be changed.,204,53520,201102
"Amend the Constitution to Give Dáil committees Full Powers of Investigation:  The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of Dáil committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis",204,53520,201102
"Reduce the number of committees and give key committees constitutional standing: The Dáil needs fewer but stronger committees, resourced properly",204,53520,201102
"De-politicise Committee Work: Chairs of committees will be assigned on a more proportional basis, while legislation will typically be introduced in a heads of Bill format to increase the chance of cross-party support",204,53520,201102
"Initiation of Legislation and Guillotines: We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills.",204,53520,201102
Women in Politics: Fine Gael recognises that there needs to be a substantial increase in the number of women in politics.,706,53520,201102
"We will ask the Citizens Assembly, which is examining electoral reform, to make recommendations as to how the number of women in politics can be increased.",706,53520,201102
Devolving Power to Citizens: Government is too centralised and unaccountable. Fine Gael believes that there must also be a real shift in power from the State to the citizen.,201,53520,201102
Open Government Bill: This will significantly strengthen Freedom of Information; establish a “whistleblowers charter”;,304,53520,201102
register all lobbyists; and create a new Electoral Commission.,202,53520,201102
A Ban on Corporate Donations: Fine Gael will introduce the necessary legal and constitutional provisions to ban corporate donations to political parties.,304,53520,201102
Stronger Local Government:  We will move many of the functions currently being performed by agencies – such as community employment and enterprise supports – back to local government and ensure that all property-related revenues are part of the income stream of local government.,301,53520,201102
Reducing  the Voting Age to 17 and Giving Citizens the Right to Vote at Irish Embassies in the Presidential Election:  If this experiment is deemed a success Fine Gael will consider extending this practice to general elections.,204,53520,201102
"Cleaning Up State Boards: Where appropriate, Agency boards will be scrapped and managers will be accountable directly to Ministers on performance against targets.",303,53520,201102
"Where Agencies can justify continued separate legal identities and boards of governance, we will strengthen their democratic accountability by introducing parliamentary scrutiny of the appointment of their chairpersons.",204,53520,201102
"Vacancies for all remaining paid directorships on public boards will be advertised on the website of the Public Appointments Service, and short-lists of qualified applicants will be presented to Ministers.",303,53520,201102

Severance Pay and Pensions: Fine Gael will abolish severance pay for Ministers.,303,53520,201102
We will restrict the payment of pensions to politicians so that a pension can only be received after someone has ceased to be a TD and reached the national retirement age (currently 65).,303,53520,201102
"We will cap taxpayers subsidies for pension schemes for politicians (and indeed for everybody) that deliver income in retirement of more than €60,000.",303,53520,201102
Ministerial Cars: We will halve the cost of the existing provision of ministerial transport.,303,53520,201102
We will end the automatic entitlement to a State car for every Government Minister.,303,53520,201102
"Instead, Ministers will be encouraged to take public transport or use a personal car where appropriate.",303,53520,201102
"We will also introduce a car pooling system for Office Holders, where cars are available at short notice with security-cleared drivers for Ministers.",303,53520,201102
"Government Jet: We will introduce a new code of practice for the use of the government jet, ensuring transparent and cost effective travel.",303,53520,201102
"To stamp out any abuse, cheaper commercial alternatives must be taken when possible and permission to use the jet will require sanction from the Taoiseach’s Department.",304,53520,201102
Ireland now relies on other Governments and international institutions to fund our State.,414,53520,201102
That Ireland has been brought to this tragic juncture in our history reflects a massive loss of market and international political confidence in the last Government’s economic policies.,305,53520,201102
Bringing order back to our public finances is now crucial to restoring our national sovereignty.,414,53520,201102
Those who founded the State sought to create the economic foundations for our political independence.,414,53520,201102
"The purpose of the next Government, and the next generation, will be to turn again to that task.",414,53520,201102

"€9 Billion 3-year Deficit Reduction Programme: Fine Gael’s Budgetary Programme sets out a 3-year budget programme delivering €8.9 billion in deficit reduction measures by 2014,",414,53520,201102
including growthenhancing measures and other policies needed to bring order back to our public finances in a fair and credible manner.,410,53520,201102
"A Current Budget Surplus by 2016: On the basis that Ireland achieves the growth rates projected under the ESRI’s Recovery Scenarios (“low growth scenario” updated in July 2010), Fine Gael will achieve a surplus of revenues over the day-to-day cost of running the Government by 2016.",414,53520,201102
"By 2016, a Fine Gael Government will only borrow to finance the investments needed for a growing economy and population.",414,53520,201102
"Earmarking the Proceeds of Growth to Debt Reduction and Investment: In setting this target, Fine Gael is committing to using any proceeds of growth over the final two years of the next Government to finance debt reduction and/or investment, rather than the types of pre-election tax and current spending give-aways under Fianna Fáil that have so damaged our economy.",414,53520,201102
"Renegotiating the IMF-EU Programme of Support: While Fine Gael accepts the IMF-EU deficit reduction targets, we will seek to renegotiate with our EU partners to make the total cost of the bail-out package more sustainable and affordable.",109,53520,201102
Making Irish taxpayers borrow up to €25 billion in additional funds from the EU / IMF at 5.8% to cover additional bank losses from fire-sales of loans and other bank assets to UK hedge funds could push Irish Government debt to unsustainable levels and hinder recovery.,410,53520,201102

"aimed at supporting demand and employment, and at providing the basis for sustainable, export-led growth.",410,53520,201102
"These will be profitable, commercial investments.",410,53520,201102
"In this way, these investments will not count as Government expenditure, and their benefits to jobs, growth and taxation will underpin fiscal consolidation.",410,53520,201102
"Keeping Tax Increases to a Minimum: Under a Fine Gael Government, tax increases will constitute 27% – or €2.4bn – of the €8.9bn in measures needed to hit our fiscal targets.",414,53520,201102
International evidence shows that tax hikes on average raise the unemployment rate by three times more than spending cuts.,414,53520,201102
"This approach will bring total Government spending back to 50% of GNP by 2014, from 59% in 2010.",414,53520,201102
"This will also set Ireland on a path towards the share of tax and Government spending in the economy recorded in the late 1990s,",414,53520,201102
when the Irish economy was returned to full employment through strong export-led growth.,410,53520,201102
12.5% Rate of Corporation Profit Tax: Fine Gael will protect the Corporation Profit Tax rate at 12.5%.,402,53520,201102
"Our low corporation profit tax rate remains an anchor of Irish industrial policy that draws foreign direct investment and jobs into Ireland, fosters innovation and keeps companies from leaving for non-European lower cost locations.",402,53520,201102
"No Further Increases in Income Taxes: Following the massive income tax hikes of recent years, as well as the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, Ireland is no longer a low tax country when it comes to income tax.",414,53520,201102
"That is why Fine Gael opposes proposals to raise either the standard 20% or the top 41% rate of income tax, or the further reductions to tax credits and bands proposed in the Government’s 4-year plan.",414,53520,201102
"Combining the top 41% income tax rate, 4% employees’ PRSI and the top 7% Universal Social Contribution, the marginal rate is already 52% for income earned over €32,700 per annum.",408,53520,201102
Increasing the marginal rate further would be counterproductive.,414,53520,201102
"It would discourage people from working harder, doing overtime and aiming for promotion.",410,53520,201102
"It would inhibit companies from creating and locating highly-paid knowledge economy in Ireland, and it would push self-employed people into the grey economy.",410,53520,201102
Employers’ PRSI: There will be no increased tax on employment such as Employers’ PRSI which can be as high at 10.75%.,402,53520,201102
"To help employers hire people off the dole, we will halve Employers’ PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week for two years.",402,53520,201102
"VAT Reform: The rise in the standard 21% rate of VAT committed to by this Government will be accompanied by a temporary (2-year) cut of at least 1.5% in the reduced 13.5% rate of VAT on labourintensive services (construction, hotels, restaurants, hairdressing, newspapers etc.), bringing it down to 12%.",409,53520,201102
This will boost the competitiveness of our tourism sector,410,53520,201102
and help divert domestic consumer spending from import-intensive goods into labour-intensive domestic services.,409,53520,201102
DIRT: Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) will be increased from 25% to 30% to encourage higher levels of household consumption.,409,53520,201102
"Carbon Tax: The €15 per tonne increase in the carbon tax (to €30 per tonne) proposed by government for 2014 is excessive,",402,53520,201102
and will be particularly hard felt by the elderly and in rural Ireland.,706,53520,201102
"We will reduce the increase proposed in Fianna Fail’s Manifesto by €5 per tonne (to €25), with the effect that, compared with Fianna Fail’s proposals, a bag of coal will be 60c cheaper, a tank of petrol (60 ltr) will be 78c cheaper, and a 1,000 litres of fuel oil for home heating will be €17 cheaper.",409,53520,201102
"The application to solid fuels of the higher carbon tax proposed by Fianna Fail will be phased in only when progress is made to control imports of dirtier, more carbon-intensive solid fuels from the UK.",409,53520,201102
"To keep our food industry competitive, we will provide an exemption from the additional carbon tax increases for agricultural diesel.",410,53520,201102
Travel Tax: International access is vital to Irish economic recovery.,410,53520,201102
That is why Fine Gael will abolish the €3 travel tax subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to re-open closed routes and bring more tourists into Ireland.,402,53520,201102
"If no deal can be done, there will be no reduction in the tax.",402,53520,201102
"A Single Business Tax for Micro Enterprises: Fine Gael will direct the Revenue Commissioners to examine the feasibility of introducing – on a revenue neutral basis – a Single Business Tax for micro enterprises (with a turnover of less than €75,000 per annum) to replace all the existing taxes on sole traders and small businesses (i.e. income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, VAT and PRSI).",402,53520,201102
This could cut compliance costs and make starting a business much less daunting.,402,53520,201102
Making the R&D Tax Credit More Accessible to Small Firms: We will amend the R&D tax regime to make it more attractive to smaller businesses.,402,53520,201102
"All R&D expenditures below €100,000 in any one year will become allowable, as opposed to just the increment over the 2003 base year.",402,53520,201102
We will also give companies the option to offset the R&D credit against employers’ PRSI as an alternative to corporation tax.,402,53520,201102
"Accelerated Capital Allowances on Software Purchases: To help companies to finance additional investment in technology, we will accelerate Capital Allowances (from eight to three years) on software purchases.",402,53520,201102
"This will not only support local, high-tech jobs in the software industry but will also facilitate productivity increase across the economy.",410,53520,201102
"Simplifying Tax Compliance: We will allow all companies to base their preliminary corporation tax returns on prior year tax liabilities, reducing their need to hire advisers to estimate their current year tax liabilities before the year is finished.",402,53520,201102
"We will also combine PRSI and tax data for employees, and simplify PRSI classes.",402,53520,201102
"To ensure that this is a revenue neutral proposal for the State, we will also consider bringing forward a proportion of the payment to earlier in the fiscal year.",402,53520,201102
Civil Partnership: We will amend tax law in a second Finance Act in 2011 to give effect to the rights for civil partners and cohabiting couples introduced in the Civil Partnership Act 2010.,705,53520,201102
"Closing Down Tax Loopholes for the Rich: Income tax yields will be increased by restricting or eliminating tax expenditures, tax shelters and tax exemptions to ensure that the wealthy cannot avoid paying their fair share.",503,53520,201102
"We will suspend (now closed) property-based tax reliefs (subject to the forthcoming impact assessment study), introduce new residency rules for tax exiles (as per the Commission on Taxation’s “Economic Test” and reduce the thresh-hold of the application of the minimum effective 30% tax rate to €250,000.",503,53520,201102
"Water Charges: Fine Gael will only support the introduction of household water charges when responsibility for water delivery is transferred from 34 local authorities to a single national water company, which will be responsible for cutting operating costs and making the investments needed to fix water leaks, as set out in detail in our NewERA plan.",501,53520,201102
"Bank Dividends/Levy: As banks return to profitability and private ownership, we will target additional contributions from the sector to repay the Irish taxpayer for the cost of the bank bail-outs.",412,53520,201102
"Initially, these contributions will be in the form of dividends, but will over time be restructured into an additional bank levy on the liabilities of the Irish banks that receive an explicit or implicit guarantee from the Irish State.",412,53520,201102
"Funding Local Government: Fianna Fail’s proposal, now endorsed by the Labour Party, to introduce by 2014 an annual, recurring residential property tax on the family home is unfair.",301,53520,201102
"But as we tackle the fiscal crisis, we will have to cut central exchequer funding for local authorities,",505,53520,201102
and we recognise that local authorities will have to find more sustainable sources of revenue appropriate to local circumstances.,301,53520,201102
What will be viewed as fair in South Dublin might be viewed as unworkable in rural Clare.,301,53520,201102
"In this context, we will empower local authorities to put in place, following the 2014 local elections, fairer alternatives to Fianna Fail’s and Labour’s recurring annual tax on the family home.",301,53520,201102
"No extra local taxes, forcing local authorities to close non-priority services and / or to deliver increased efficiencies;",301,53520,201102
Increased local user charges for waste etc.; or,301,53520,201102
The option of a local “site sale profits tax”.,301,53520,201102
"Such a tax would be levied on the profit made from the site value on the sale of a residence (sales proceeds, less cost indexed by inflation, less stamp duty paid and less home improvements)",301,53520,201102
The final measure might be considered as both fairer and more economically sensible than an annual recurring property tax.,503,53520,201102
"Whichever option local electorates choose, for the first time since the 1970s local government will have real independence from central government in deciding what services to provide at local level and how to fund them.",301,53520,201102
Environmental Taxes: We will auction carbon permits under the EU Emissions Trading System from 2013. .,501,53520,201102
"Following consultation with industry, Fine Gael will introduce a new levy on packaging to prevent excess waste from entering the waste cycle in the first instance.",416,53520,201102
Betting Tax: Fine Gael will draw from successful betting tax regimes in other jurisdictions to capture revenue from overseas online betting operations that sell into the Irish market.,402,53520,201102
The current regime will only raise revenues from Irish operators and is therefore a tax on Irish jobs.,305,53520,201102
"A Fair Pensions Tax Reform: As a fairer and more effective alternative to Fianna Fail’s plans, we will make tax savings of a similar scale through a combination of the following measures:",504,53520,201102
"A temporary, annual 0.5% contribution for all private pension funds, so that older beneficiaries of past tax relief make some contribution to deficit reduction.",505,53520,201102

An increase in the “deemed distribution” rate on large (Annual Retirement Funds ARFs) to avoid their use for inheritance tax planning.,505,53520,201102
"Capping Tax Relief on Big Pensions: The net objective of our changes will be to cap taxpayer contributions to existing public and private sector schemes that deliver pensions of greater than €60,000 in retirement, while maintaining adequate incentives for younger, middle incomes families to continue to save for their retirement.",505,53520,201102
"There will, per usual, be transition arrangements for those approaching retirement.",505,53520,201102
Fair Tax Treatment of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs): We will put the tax treatment of employer contributions to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) on an equal footing with employer contributions to occupational pension schemes.,504,53520,201102
"Additional Reduction in Back-Office Public Sector Numbers: As set out in our Reinventing Government plan, Fine Gael will reduce the size of the public service by 10% – just over 30,000 – without undermining key front-line services in health, policing and education, through over 105 reforms to cut back-office bureaucracy and delivery improved value for money.",303,53520,201102
"This means that Fine Gael will reduce back-office administrative positions in the public service by an additional 18,000 over and above the 12,000 reduction set out in Fianna Fail’s 4-year plan and by an additional 12,000 over the 18,000 reduction set out in Labour’s plan.",303,53520,201102
All of these extra reductions will be targeted at back-office administrative functions.,303,53520,201102
These extra reductions will be achieved through voluntary redundancies.,303,53520,201102
"A Smaller Civil Service: As part of the overall reduction in numbers, the numbers of staff working in central Government Departments will be cut by one-third, in part through six new shared-service operations in Payments and Entitlements; Business Inspections; Pay and Pensions Administration; Procurement and Property Management; IT; and Finance and Accounting.",303,53520,201102

"Additional Measures to Cut Public Sector Payroll Costs: Excluding savings from headcount reductions, Fine Gael will seek additional payroll savings of 1% each year, to be negotiated and delivered locally, out of the costs of overtime, sick leave, flexitime, special allowances and expenses.",303,53520,201102
Leading by Example: A Fine Gael Government will implement the pay reductions for the 650 most senior public servants recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in 2009.,303,53520,201102

This review will be steered by a senior cabinet sub-committee and will critically examine every public spending programme against six key tests:,303,53520,201102

Should the service be funded by taxpayers or service users?,303,53520,201102
Is the State the best provider?,303,53520,201102
Is it effective in meeting its goals?,303,53520,201102
Can its efficiency be improved?,303,53520,201102
Is it affordable in the current context?,303,53520,201102
"An Bord Snip: As part of the CSR, we will deliver at least half of the savings options from the Special Group on Public Expenditure and Numbers (“An Bord Snip”) including 100% if the savings recommended in the Oireachtas budget.",303,53520,201102

"By treating people with chronic illnesses in the community instead of acute hospitals, by only paying hospitals for what they deliver instead of giving them block budgets and ultimately by dismantling the expensive HSE bureaucracy,",504,53520,201102

Making Work Pay: Welfare will be reformed to make re-entry into paid work more attractive.,505,53520,201102
"As wage levels in the economy revert to more competitive levels in order to protect employment, it will be necessary and fair to also reduce social welfare payments for those with the capacity to work beginning with €3 weekly cuts in 2012 and 2013 and a final €4 cut in 2014.",505,53520,201102

We will require local authorities to target accident black spots for prioritised upgrade.,301,53520,201102
"We will also ensure the increased use of speed cameras, specifically in accident black spots.",605,53520,201102
Rewarding Successful Programmes: We recognise the success of the National Cycle Policy Framework and the Dublin Bikes initiative.,502,53520,201102
We will continue to invest in these programmes.,502,53520,201102
"Prioritise Cyclists and Pedestrians: We will ensure that cyclists and pedestrians have priority over road traffic in built up areas and central business districts, thus further encouraging low carbon travel.",501,53520,201102
Safe Cycling: We realise the need to redesign cycle-ways to improve the safety and priority of cyclists as set out in our local government reform document.,502,53520,201102
"Airport Charges: Fine Gael will work with the Aviation Regulator to cut airport charges in order to deliver increased routes, airlines and passenger numbers.",403,53520,201102
We will ensure that the Dublin Airport Authority is exposed to benchmarking and competition within its sector.,403,53520,201102
"We will allow Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports operate independently.",301,53520,201102
Regional Airports: We continue to support the role of our regional airports in a pro-active regional development strategy.,301,53520,201102
Travel Tax: International access is vital to Irish economic recovery.,410,53520,201102
That is why Fine Gael will abolish the €3 travel tax subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to re-open closed routes and bring more tourists into Ireland.,402,53520,201102
"If no deal can be done, there will be no reduction in the tax.",402,53520,201102
"Air Traffic Controllers: As an island nation, Air Traffic Controllers provide an essential service to the Irish economy.",704,53520,201102
We will legislate to ensure any ATC grievances must first be taken to the Labour Relations Commission and then Labour Court before any industrial action can take place.,702,53520,201102
"Despite the crisis, the irish economy has enduring strengths.",601,53620,201102
these have survived the downturn and give this country a good platform for our recovery:,601,53620,201102
"A young, well-educated workforce",504,53620,201102
Favourable demographics,601,53620,201102
High quality physical infrastructure,411,53620,201102
An open economy with a strong high-technology exporting base,407,53620,201102
A pro-enterprise environment,401,53620,201102
A highly flexible economy,401,53620,201102
the aim of every action Fianna Fáil has taken in government over the last three years has been to return our country to the path of sustainable economic growth in which jobs can be created and protected.,414,53620,201102
The decisions we have taken have  been difficult.,305,53620,201102
But they have been the right decisions for our citizens.,305,53620,201102
the latest economic data prove this.,414,53620,201102
Last month’s exchequer returns show tax revenues have stabilised and public spending is under control.,414,53620,201102
Conditions in the labour market are also beginning to stabilise.,408,53620,201102
"Last month, the Live Register fell by nearly 7,000 and is down 11,000 since its peak in august.",408,53620,201102
"over 90,000 new jobs will be created during the lifetime of the National Recovery Plan.",408,53620,201102
The labour  market reforms contained in the Plan will assist job creation and will guard against  the scourge of endemic long-term unemployment.,408,53620,201102
"it is important to recall that there are still 1.86 million working in ireland, up from 1.5 million in 1998.",408,53620,201102
"Faced with the rapid deterioration in our public finances, Fianna Fáil took swift and decisive action.",305,53620,201102
We have worked continuously to bring our budgetary position under control.,414,53620,201102
"In six separate budgetary adjustments since July 2008 including  the last Budget, we have made savings and raised revenue to the value of over €20 billion.",414,53620,201102
"We successfully stabilised the deficit in 2010 and as a result of the decisions we took in the budget, it will come in below 10% of GDP in 2011.",414,53620,201102
Our National Recovery Plan spells out in detail the measures we will take in government over the next four years to return our public finances to a sustainable position.,414,53620,201102
"With savings of just over €20 billion, we are already two thirds of the way through the overall adjustment of €30 billion required to bring our deficit down below 3% of GDP by 2014.",414,53620,201102
We continue to provide substantial resources for public services.,504,53620,201102
this year we will spend €20.1 billion on social welfare;,504,53620,201102
€14.1 billion on health;,504,53620,201102
and €9.2 billion on education.,506,53620,201102
"over the lifetime of the Plan, current spending will be brought back to 2007 levels.",414,53620,201102
We have sought to protect essential services while making savings by reducing staff numbers and pay costs.,504,53620,201102
the public service pay bill has been reduced by €1.8 billion since 2009.,505,53620,201102
the national Recovery Plan commits us to bringing the overall figure down to €14.7 billion by 2014.,414,53620,201102
Public service staff numbers will be brought back to 2005 levels.,414,53620,201102
the reduction in numbers over the last two years has resulted in increased productivity.,414,53620,201102
the reductions in numbers set out in the national Recovery Plan will require further significant improvements in performance and service delivery across all parts of the public service.,414,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil will continue to work with public servants to ensure that the reforms necessary to achieve the targets in the Plan are achieved.,505,53620,201102
that is the only way in which we can build a sustainable public service for our citizens.,504,53620,201102
our approach to spending reductions has been balanced and has been guided by the need to protect our long term economic interest.,408,53620,201102
"For that reason, we have prioritised investment in education",506,53620,201102
and we have ensured that the reductions that have been achieved in this area do not impact on frontline services.,506,53620,201102
"the numbers employed in education will increase over the period of the Plan by nearly 2,500 to meet demographic needs.",506,53620,201102
there will be no reduction in the number of special needs assistants in our schools over the period of the Plan: it will be capped at 2011 levels.,506,53620,201102
Spending on public investment projects increased substantially between 1997 and  2008.,411,53620,201102
"this investment has transformed the quality of our national road network, our public transport system,",411,53620,201102
and our education and,506,53620,201102
health infrastructure,504,53620,201102
as well as our national sport and cultural facilities.,502,53620,201102
Capital spending will be progressively reduced over the period of the Plan but the level of investment still compares favourably internationally and is in line with average government investment as a proportion of national income in the oeCD.,411,53620,201102
the reduction is also mitigated by the greater value the state is now getting for the taxpayer in public capital projects.,303,53620,201102
The NPRF will also increase its level of investment in public infrastructure projects  that provide a return to the fund.,411,53620,201102
"We cannot tax our way out of a recession,",401,53620,201102
as the Labour Party and sinn Féin are proposing to do.,305,53620,201102
But we must have a tax system that will raise the revenue we need to pay for essential public services without hindering economic development.,408,53620,201102
it was simply not sustainable that 45% of income earners paid no tax.,408,53620,201102
"Under our Plan, two thirds of the money we need to bridge the gap in our public finances will come from savings in public spending.",414,53620,201102
the remaining one third will be raised in taxation.,408,53620,201102
all taxpayers will contribute according to their means.,503,53620,201102
those who have most will pay the most and no group will be sheltered.,503,53620,201102
the bulk of the income tax increases we have proposed under the national Recovery Plan have now been introduced.,408,53620,201102
any further tax increases over the next four years will largely be in the area of indirect taxation and by means of the closing of tax breaks and will be broadly based.,408,53620,201102
our economic recovery will be driven by high valued-added businesses in highend manufacturing and services.,410,53620,201102
High income taxes will kill off prospects for growth in these crucial sectors.,402,53620,201102
We know from our history that punitive taxes drive out investment and stifle employment.,402,53620,201102
The tax changes contained in our plan will  broaden the base by bringing more taxpayers into the tax net and by abolishing or curtailing the tax exemptions and reliefs used by higher earners to reduce their tax bill.,408,53620,201102
these changes will bring us back to an income tax structure last seen in 2006.,408,53620,201102
a fundamental principle of our plan is to continue to protect the most vulnerable.,503,53620,201102
analysis by the esRi shows that the budgetary measures introduced over the past 2½ years have been progressive and have distributed the burden fairly.,503,53620,201102
We have significantly increased the state pension over the past ten years and,504,53620,201102
it is our view that the security this has brought to older people should be preserved.,706,53620,201102
our commitment is to achieve the further savings needed in social welfare spending through reform of the system and enhanced control measures.,504,53620,201102
the repair of our public finances will enable us to win back the confidence of business and consumers in our economy.,414,53620,201102
But we must also have a strategy for growth.,410,53620,201102
"as a small open trading nation, the only path to sustainable recovery is through export-led growth.",407,53620,201102
The Irish economy enjoyed strong export-driven growth as  recently as the 1990s.,407,53620,201102
We can do so again.,410,53620,201102
the consumption and construction fuelled boom of the last decade put upward pressure on our cost structures and undermined our competitiveness.,414,53620,201102
"as a result, we lost market share in international trade.",407,53620,201102
the steps we have taken since 2008 have resulted in a marked improvement in our competitiveness.,408,53620,201102
ireland is the only eU member state in which the level of consumer prices has fallen in recent years.,408,53620,201102
Wages have been reduced.,408,53620,201102
energy and other utility costs have fallen.,408,53620,201102
"the european Commission forecasts that by 2012, ireland’s competitiveness will have improved by 14%.",408,53620,201102
"This downward adjustment of our cost base together with the recovery in the  global economy is producing a strong, broadly-based revival in our exports.",407,53620,201102
our exports are now at their highest level ever.,407,53620,201102
Recent data show that our manufacturing sector is growing at its fastest rate in 11 years.,410,53620,201102
Both the multinational sector and indigenous exporters are winning increased market share abroad.,407,53620,201102
"many export businesses, in sectors ranging from agri-food and agriculture to computer software, healthcare and financial services, will create new jobs this year and next year to meet rising demand.",407,53620,201102
Irish operations  of multinational companies are successfully competing for new investment in this country:,407,53620,201102
Last year was the best year since 2006 for new foreign direct investment into ireland.,407,53620,201102
the success of our export sectors is proof that Fianna Fáil’s policies to return the economy to export-led growth are working.,407,53620,201102
we must continue to drive down the cost of doing business;,414,53620,201102
we must continue to invest in education and skills;,506,53620,201102
public investment in key infrastructure projects must be maintained;,411,53620,201102
and we must continue to encourage businesses to innovate to compete.,411,53620,201102
export growth will in turn boost consumer spending and investment.,407,53620,201102
"this will create new jobs in hard-hit sectors such as retailing, hospitality and construction.",408,53620,201102
the new minimum wage and the reform of employment agreements are crucial to the revival of these key jobs-rich sectors of the economy.,412,53620,201102
Our National Recovery  Plan shows in detail how we will deliver on these promises and grow employment.,404,53620,201102
We have protected investment in employment by increasing the budget allocations for the iDa and enterprise ireland.,411,53620,201102
enterprise capital expenditure will rise from 10.8% to 15.9% over the period of the Plan.,411,53620,201102
"this investment will support job creation in world class, export oriented enterprises.",411,53620,201102
Infrastructural investment has been focussed on employment rich projects such  as the national retrofit programme and in water services which will provide employment in the construction sector.,411,53620,201102
"Reduce energy, waste, rental costs and local authority charges for businesses.",402,53620,201102
Make next generation broadband available to more businesses.,411,53620,201102
"Boost key labour-intensive domestic sectors such as agriculture, agri-food,  tourism, retail and construction.",408,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil is aware that people are worried about their mortgages.,403,53620,201102
the party is very conscious of the high value placed on home ownership in ireland and in particular of the efforts irish people make to secure and retain their own home.,401,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil policy is that home owners who lose their jobs should be assisted to  retain their homes during their period of unemployment.,412,53620,201102
at the request of Fianna Fáil in government a Code of Conduct for mortgage arrears (CCma) was introduced and subsequently this code has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect present economic circumstances.,412,53620,201102
Banks and other lenders are required to comply with the revised CCma as a matter of law from Jan 1st 2011 but have been given a period of six months’ grace  (from Jan 1st 2011) to deal with administration support issues.,403,53620,201102
Lenders are prohibited from moving homeowners in arrears off existing  tracker mortgages.,403,53620,201102
"Homeowners in arrears who co-operate with their lenders under a Mortgage  arrears Resolution Process (maRP), which has been put in place in all the regulated institutions, will not incur penalty interest charges;",403,53620,201102
Harassment of mortgage holders through unsolicited communications has  been outlawed.,403,53620,201102
"Homeowners in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, will be allowed to  have their cases dealt with under the maRP.",403,53620,201102
The existing 12 month moratorium on legal action in arrears cases is restated  and clarified in the new code.,403,53620,201102
Qualifying loans taken out in 2012 will receive  the relief at a reduced rate of  15% for first time buyers and 10% for non first time buyers with ceilings of €6000 per annum for married couples and €3000 per annum single people.,412,53620,201102
The revised CCMA was published on 6 December 2010 and came into effect  on 1 January 2011.,403,53620,201102
We established an Independent Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert  Group to look at the issue of mortgage arrears and how best to assist homeowners in difficulty.,403,53620,201102
they determined after looking at international best practice the best solution was to introduce a deferred interest scheme (Dis).,403,53620,201102
a deferred interest scheme (Dis) allows borrowers who can pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest and will provide eligible mortgage holders with an extended period to get back on their feet.,403,53620,201102
Furthermore under the Dis deferred interest is put into a deferred interest account and no penalties is charged on the interest.,403,53620,201102
Lenders representing the majority of the market have indicated their  willingness to implement the Dis.,403,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil will amend the enforcement of court orders act to prohibit the  granting of a court order for the repossession of a primary family residence unless all of the steps above are met to the satisfaction of the court.,403,53620,201102
"While the Dis is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.",403,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil is totally committed to introducing the new laws required:,412,53620,201102
"In the case of the Department of Finance, recommendations on the scope  and the admissibility in Court of the CCma  is being progressed.",403,53620,201102
Legislative changes to the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme will be  introduced in the Department of social Protection.,403,53620,201102
New regulations and guidance regime will ensure that housing authorities  will disregard the household’s current accommodation for the purposes of determining eligibility for social housing support.,403,53620,201102
"this will involve a new needs assessment process which will allow an earlier trigger point for the social housing needs assessment process to take place where a case has been determined to be unsustainable in the long term, following exploration of all other options.",403,53620,201102
Bankruptcy legislation must be modernised.,408,53620,201102
We will introduce a non-judicial debt settlement system so that families can  be protected as much as possible from losing their homes.,403,53620,201102
it is worth recalling what Fianna Fáil in Government has already done to support those in difficulty with their mortgages.,403,53620,201102
"Provided financial help to almost 18,000 borrowers, through the Mortgage  interest subsidy scheme",504,53620,201102
Increased the advisory services provided through the Money Advice  Budgeting services,504,53620,201102
Introduced the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears for all  lenders requiring all major banks and lending agencies to protect the home  owner as much as possible,403,53620,201102
Extended the 6 month moratorium on legal proceedings to 12 months,403,53620,201102
Refocussed mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at  the peak of the market with extensions up to the end of 2017,504,53620,201102
Established the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group to  protect home owners and implemented its recommendations,403,53620,201102
Reduced the rate of stamp duty in Budget 2011 which will facilitate trading  down for some borrowers in difficulty.,402,53620,201102
"We have put all political considerations aside to stand behind our banking system through state guarantees, nama and the recapitalisation of individual institutions.",414,53620,201102
We have revamped our system of banking regulation and have brought in new regulators with proven expertise to make sure that past failings will never be repeated.,403,53620,201102
every decision we have taken has been guided by the need to maintain a financial system that will serve the needs of the economy.,414,53620,201102
the eU/imF Programme for the banking system builds upon and intensifies our approach to fixing the banks.,414,53620,201102
it provides the funding to restructure and recapitalise our banking system so that the banks remain safe places for deposits and can support the economic recovery by lending to creditworthy businesses and households.,414,53620,201102
the Programme provides for a fundamental downsizing and reorganisation of the banking sector to make it more proportionate to the size of the economy.,414,53620,201102
"When the Programme is complete, irish banks will be capitalised to the highest international standards and be able to return to normal market sources of funding.",414,53620,201102
"the Programme provides €10 billion for immediate additional bank recapitalisation and the remaining €25 billion to be used as a contingency fund, only to be drawn down if needed.",414,53620,201102
"in government, Fianna Fáil will meet this country’s obligations under the eU/imF Programme.",404,53620,201102
"Under the Programme, ireland will have access to €50 billion of funds needed to maintain social welfare, the health service, the education system and other services.",404,53620,201102
"€50 billion in new borrowing is the amount that the state will require to finance itself over the next three years, assuming the Government sticks to the targets for reducing the budget deficit that were agreed in the Programme.",414,53620,201102
We also have access to additional funding that is necessary to resolve the remaining issues in irish banking.,414,53620,201102
ireland’s average interest rate will be around 5.8% for loans that are on average for 7½ years.,408,53620,201102
These interest rates were set long before we applied to join the EU/ imF Programme.,107,53620,201102
the Programme provides these funds at a far lower rate than currently available on the market – if we could get the funds at all.,107,53620,201102
the rates charged are exactly the same as those for any other country borrowing in similar circumstances – no better or worse.,107,53620,201102
"Despite a series of significant measures taken at european level since the Greek crisis last spring to ensure the euro’s long-term stability, a decisive solution to the euro area debt crisis has not been found.",108,53620,201102
that is why governments in eU member states have been working together intensely over recent months to redesign the euro area institutions and reconfigure the european bail-out funds.,108,53620,201102
one issue being discussed as part of these talks is the interest rate charged to any member state that borrows from these funds.,108,53620,201102
"as a borrower, ireland would clearly benefit from a reduction in the rate currently on offer.",108,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil is continuing to work towards this aim.,305,53620,201102
Brian Lenihan has successfully worked to get the issue of a reduction in the interest rate onto the agenda and progress is being made at the eU level on this issue.,305,53620,201102
Governments from the 17 euro area and the 27 eU member states are expected to agree a comprehensive package of reforms to the rescue funds by end-march.,108,53620,201102
it is obvious that the terms of the eU/imF Programme - from the interest rate on the loans to the issue of defaulting of senior bonds – cannot be renegotiated unilaterally.,108,53620,201102
Yet during this election debate we have heard the opposition parties talk about “tearing up” the agreement: its either “Frankfurt’s way or Labour’s way” we’ve been told.,305,53620,201102
such bravado is reckless and dangerous and is bound to prove counterproductive.,305,53620,201102
the Labour Party are pretending that they can borrow more from the eU/imF than already agreed – yet somehow do so at a lower interest rate.,305,53620,201102
their plan to stretch out the fiscal adjustment to 2016 and run larger deficits over the next few  years means that €50 billion will not be enough.,305,53620,201102
it is nonsense to think that our colleagues in europe will reward shirking from our budgetary commitments under the Programme with more favourable borrowing terms.,414,53620,201102
We need to show that we can meet our targets and put our house in order.,414,53620,201102
more favourable terms are likely to be available only to borrowers with a record of achievement in reducing budget deficits.,414,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil has delivered €20.5 billion of the €30 billion budgetary adjustment required.,414,53620,201102
We have proven that we can deliver.,305,53620,201102
"even if this country had not entered an eU/imF Programme, we would need to aim to reduce our deficit to near balance by 2014.",414,53620,201102
Prolonging the adjustment means  accumulating more national debt to hand down to our children.,414,53620,201102
it will fuel doubts among investors about our ability to restore order to the public finances.,414,53620,201102
"and as we know from the 1980s, such doubts are a recipe for economic stagnation and rising unemployment.",414,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil’s national Recovery Plan will build on the many positive aspects of our economy so that we can return to a sustainable growth path.,404,53620,201102
the eU/imF Programme is based on our national Recovery Plan.,404,53620,201102
Remove barriers to growth,410,53620,201102
Boost our competitiveness,410,53620,201102
Restore order to our public finances,414,53620,201102
Repair our banking system so that it can serve the recovery,414,53620,201102
our future prosperity rests upon the implementation of the Plan over the next four years.,404,53620,201102
We wrote the Plan.,404,53620,201102
We believe in the Plan.,404,53620,201102
We are the party best placed to implement it.,305,53620,201102

Fianna Fáil has introduced a series of successful measures over the past two years to assist redundant apprentices to complete their on-the-job training.,701,53620,201102
"Fianna Fáil  is now committed to an investment of over €7 million in 2011 with the objective of  providing on-the-job training for up to a further 1,000 apprentices in the public  and private sectors.",411,53620,201102
We will also continue to fund a number of other labour market activation measures to assist up to a further 700 redundant apprentices and craftspersons.,411,53620,201102
Fianna Fáil is strongly committed to supporting the further education sector and has maintained the level of funding invested in adult and further education despite the budgetary challenges faced.,506,53620,201102
the level of overall expenditure on further education has grown from over €177 million in 2000 to almost €426 million last year.,506,53620,201102

"the aim of this new initiative will be to increase the number of part-time and flexible up-skilling opportunities available  in the higher education sector,",506,53620,201102
so that people can continue to look for work and be available to take up employment while upgrading their qualifications and skills.,506,53620,201102
it is essential to address urgently the economic and employment issues dealt with in the first two sections of this manifesto.,408,53620,201102
"However, more long-term action is required.",204,53620,201102
a core principle for this manifesto is that we must learn the mistakes of the past by implementing a substantial programme of fundamental reform.,303,53620,201102
all  mature  democracies  should  be  willing  to  undertake  an  open  review  of  their political culture.,202,53620,201102
Of the many major failings in Ireland’s political culture the  failure  of  our  parliamentary  system  to  consider  structural  problems  until  it  was too  late  is  the  most  significant.,204,53620,201102
the  dominance  of  short-term  considerations  in public  debate  is  obvious.,204,53620,201102
We believe that the essential way to assist recovery and ensure future sustainability in public policy is to radically reform the procedures for choosing and operating both parliament and government.,204,53620,201102
The objective evidence suggests three core public policy failings in recent years:,204,53620,201102
entirely inaccurate.,414,53620,201102
The tax base was narrowed too significantly with cyclical income becoming  too large a proportion of public revenues.,414,53620,201102
Oversight of the banking system signally failed.,204,53620,201102
"an examination of the records of Dáil Éireann shows that during legislative debates, questions, private members’ time and committee work the near constant refrain was the need for extra money to go to public services, for tax burdens to be lifted on various groups and for easier access to credit.",204,53620,201102
much of the debate on parliamentary reform has focussed on the issues of cost and sitting hours.,303,53620,201102
"Costs are important and must continue to be controlled,",303,53620,201102
but the most important savings can be made by a reformed oireachtas which can review and enact better public policies.,204,53620,201102
"in terms of sitting times, there is no evidence that simply increasing the number of days where the houses or committees of the oireachtas meet will make any significant change in the quality of debate, fiscal policy or legislation.",204,53620,201102
"The much more fundamental reform issue relates to the roles of members of parliament and government, their work and the system for electing them.",204,53620,201102
irish society today is so different from 1937 that it would be surprising if an electoral and government system established then was still appropriate.,204,53620,201102
"as we outline in the section dealing with how specific changes should be developed, we believe that the first step towards positive reform is to try to develop a wide consensus on what should be done",202,53620,201102
.  the level and quality of debate about systemic reform has been poor and based on assumption rather than analysis.,305,53620,201102
in this plan we are setting out our principles for reform and an absolute commitment to act within a short period.,305,53620,201102
We believe that the current electoral system has serious flaws.,204,53620,201102
It encourages  an almost perpetual campaign in irish politics and pushes representatives away from their most important roles of passing legislation and overseeing the work of government.,204,53620,201102
There is a clear disjoint between what is required to be elected and  the work of an effective parliamentarian.,204,53620,201102
twice in the past the people chose to retain the current system,202,53620,201102
". it has core merits, especially in encouraging tDs to be close to the people they represent.",203,53620,201102
"However, we believe that the case for reform is now overwhelming.",204,53620,201102
"as such, we support the introduction of a system which meets two core principles:",204,53620,201102
Retaining the direct link between tDs and the communities they serve.,202,53620,201102
ensuring that more national considerations are also represented in the,303,53620,201102
"specifically, we support a mixed system of single-seat constituencies elected through the system of single transferable vote and a top-up national list which will ensure proportional representation.",204,53620,201102
this system is found in many countries including Germany and involves using a national list of candidates from which representatives will be elected to balance underrepresentation which would emerge in the constituencies.,204,53620,201102
We support the introduction of measures to favour gender balance within the national list.,204,53620,201102
any change to our electoral system will require significant public engagement in the development of proposals as well as passage in a referendum.,202,53620,201102
We therefore intend to submit these proposals to a Citizens assembly as proposed later in this document.,202,53620,201102
much of the political analysis of the work of Dáil Éireann has been highly superficial.,303,53620,201102
many seem to confuse opportunities for partisan exchanges with promoting accountability.,305,53620,201102
the search for soundbites which can be carried in the media has overtaken reflective debate as the primary consideration during much  of the parliamentary day.,204,53620,201102
"While the problems of the Dáil are clear, proposals for reform have focussed on superficial rather than real reform.",204,53620,201102
"Without such reform, the number of tDs and the length of the hours they attend Leinster House are irrelevant policy soundbites rather than substantive solutions.",204,53620,201102
"the cost of the Dáil is important and must continue to be controlled,",303,53620,201102
but the most important issue relates to the quality of the Dáil’s work.,204,53620,201102
our proposals for reform of the electoral system and government are central to delivering fundamental Dáil reform.,204,53620,201102
However there are more immediate actions which should be taken.,204,53620,201102
Improve the Dáil’s oversight of all aspects of the public sector.,303,53620,201102
Increase the level and quality of TDs’ engagement in legislative and  budgetary processes.,303,53620,201102
Ensure that Dáil proceedings are more constructive.,202,53620,201102
The election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot.,204,53620,201102
"Save in exceptional circumstances, the principles of legislation will be  debated in advance of drafting.",204,53620,201102
The time made available for private members’ business will be extended.,202,53620,201102
"In  addition to the standard time for a motion chosen by a political group, a separate provision will be made for individual members, from any group, to introduce legislation.",202,53620,201102
All legislation will be submitted for independent fiscal analysis in advance  of  debates.,303,53620,201102
The committee system will be restructured to ensure a greater focus on  core oversight roles which will go far beyond the relatively narrow work of the Public accounts Committee.,204,53620,201102
"in particular, two new committees will be introduced:",204,53620,201102
o  a Regulatory oversight Committee which will have expert staff available to it to assist in the ongoing review of critical regulatory functions.,204,53620,201102
o  a Government oversight Committee which will be charged with overseeing corporate governance and strategic planning in the public service.,204,53620,201102
A revised budgetary process as outlined below.,303,53620,201102
To facilitate these changes the Dáil will be scheduled for a normal working  week for most of the year.,204,53620,201102
We will establish the legal services of the Oireachtas on a statutory basis.,204,53620,201102
much of the rationale for the inclusion of the seanad in Bunreacht na hÉireann has ceased to be relevant over time.,204,53620,201102
serious questions must be asked about the continued role of an entity which is still struggling to justify its existence after  three quarters of a century.,204,53620,201102
it must be stressed that during the last decade the seanad did not play a substantive role in challenging unsustainable policies.,204,53620,201102
While its debates are frequently more thoughtful than those in the Dáil this suggests the need to reform the Dáil rather than the retention of the seanad.,204,53620,201102
it is important to note that second chambers are not an essential part of parliamentary democracy.,204,53620,201102
if our proposals for the reform of the electoral system and of government are enacted we will support the abolition of the seanad.,204,53620,201102
the savings in public expenditure will be used to resource the different elements which we are proposing to improve the workings of democracy and oversight of government.,303,53620,201102
the office of President is rightly held in great esteem by the irish people and we do not see need for significant reform.,203,53620,201102
We support the reduction in the age for eligibility to run for President to 21.,204,53620,201102
We support the extension of the franchise for presidential elections to all  irish citizens including emigrants.,204,53620,201102
"We support allowing candidates for the office of presidency to be  nominated by petition of registered electors, this process to be managed by the new electoral Commission.",204,53620,201102
the structure of how we form governments is increasingly a problem given both the complexity of issues addressed by modern governments and the impact which appointing only oireachtas members has on the work of the oireachtas.,204,53620,201102
the current system effectively removes almost 20% of the membership of the Dáil from the daily work of parliament outside of their own departmental areas.,204,53620,201102
We believe that there are two major reforms which would increase the  effectiveness of both cabinet government and parliamentary oversight:,204,53620,201102
Members of Cabinet should not be members of the Oireachtas while they  serve as ministers.,204,53620,201102
o  the current irish system of limiting membership of government so drastically is unusual in international terms.,204,53620,201102
o  When members of the oireachtas are appointed to Cabinet they would be replaced by an alternate while serving as a minister.,204,53620,201102
"the alternate would be on a list published at the time of the election, in a similar way to european Parliamentary elections.",204,53620,201102
"o  they would continue to require approval by the Dáil, attend, answer questions and participate in debates but would not have votes.",204,53620,201102
o  this system would allow them to devote significantly more time to their ministerial duties and increase the number of Dáil members participating in all parliamentary duties.,204,53620,201102
"o  it would, in addition, significantly increase the accountability of ministers to the Dáil.",204,53620,201102
Persons who are not members of the Dáil would be allowed to be appointed  to serve as ministers:,204,53620,201102
o  in these cases a confirmation process would be put in place which would include a presentation of priorities before the relevant committee.,204,53620,201102
"o  in all cases, new ministers would present a detailed statement of priorities for debate by the relevant committee within one month of appointment.",204,53620,201102
it is absolutely clear that no significant programme of political reform which involves amending the constitution can succeed without a real engagement with citizens during the process of drafting proposals.,202,53620,201102
there are many ideas for how this can be achieved but none have yet been proven.,202,53620,201102
it is important to avoid a situation where expert advisers become disproportionately influential in framing  debate and drafting recommendations.,202,53620,201102
elected representatives also have an entirely legitimate role as well as expertise on this issue and they must not be excluded from the procedure – which is implied by some proposals.,202,53620,201102
"overall, we believe that a public consultation process which is focussed on achieving very clear outcomes is required.",202,53620,201102
We support the principle of a Citizen’s assembly.,202,53620,201102
this would bring together a group of citizens to debate and recommend specific proposals.,202,53620,201102
The electoral system,204,53620,201102
The Oireachtas,204,53620,201102
Government membership,204,53620,201102
We would seek to constitute the assembly so that it includes people from all sections of society – not representatives of organisations.,202,53620,201102
its work would combine a wide public consultation and non-partisan debates.,202,53620,201102
its work on these areas should be completed within six months.,202,53620,201102
the more effective the assembly is in its work the more likely it is that its recommendations will be accepted.,303,53620,201102
"However, it would be a bad start to the renewal of democratic institutions to exclude elected representatives from the process.",203,53620,201102
We do not support the proposal for a constitutional convention to tackle redrawing the entire constitution.,203,53620,201102
this would stop the clearer focus on the reform of politics and government which we believe is necessary over the next year and would be too broad to allow serious public engagement with the large number of complex issues addressed in Bunreacht na hÉireann.,203,53620,201102
the changes we have implemented have already dramatically reformed the system of political funding and election expenditure in ireland.,304,53620,201102
We support the introduction of a legal ban (by referendum if necessary)  on  all  political  donations  except  from  persons  entitled  to  vote  in  a  general election.,304,53620,201102
elections  should  be  funded  and  decided  solely  by  those  entitled to  vote.,304,53620,201102
We will also support the halving of the donation limit to political parties  and a new independent system for auditing compliance with spending and donation controls contained in the electoral acts.,304,53620,201102
We will introduce a Bill to this effect within one month of the convening of a  new Dáil.,304,53620,201102
"While ireland has elections that are held to high standards and run with absolute integrity, we support further changes which will underpin the independence of the system and target increased participation.",202,53620,201102
"We will introduce an independent electoral commission which will be  charged with running elections, maintaining the electoral register and promoting turnout, particularly through public education about the working of the electoral system.",202,53620,201102
We support a constitutional amendment to extend polling over two days in  order to facilitate higher participation.,204,53620,201102
The Commission can utilise the local authority network as in the present  system but will separate national administration and oversight from the Department of the environment & Local Government.,303,53620,201102
significant strides have been made in recent years to open government to citizens.,202,53620,201102
We support the automatic publication of all granted Freedom of Information  requests online save in limited circumstances concerning personal data.,202,53620,201102
We will formalise the requirement that all data gathered as a result of  publicly-funded research be made publicly available in a data archive.,303,53620,201102
"in addition, the outcomes of publicly-funded research programmes must be made freely available save where there are specific commercial intellectualproperty issues.",303,53620,201102
We support the continued extension of whistleblower protection.,202,53620,201102
We  believe that the best way of doing this is to continue with the stronger approach of adding sector-specific reforms into legislation.,202,53620,201102
Bunreacht na hÉireann has served ireland well since its adoption in 1937.,203,53620,201102
it has shown its ability to evolve over time in many important areas.,203,53620,201102
it is right to acknowledge its role in safeguarding democracy and securing rights.,203,53620,201102
Grandiose proposals to scrap or redraw the entire Constitution offer no positive outcomes except delaying action on the more important task of renewing our political and governing system.,203,53620,201102
"instead of sacrificing the legal certainty which comes from over 70 years of precedents, Fianna Fáil will focus on the number of specific areas where we believe amendment is desirable.",204,53620,201102
An amendment to strengthen the rights of children.,201,53620,201102
41.2 with a gender neutral version recognising parents in the home.,706,53620,201102
An amendment to provide for a court of appeal to reduce the current  waiting periods for court cases.,303,53620,201102
An amendment to address the limits placed on parliamentary enquiries by  the judgement on the Abbeylara case.,204,53620,201102
the failure of most elements of the budgetary process has been well established.,303,53620,201102
it did not prove robust enough to ensure that broad issues were examined or assumptions challenged.,303,53620,201102
The range of international reviews which projected  continued growth prove that these failings were not unique to ireland.,305,53620,201102
"However, there are important changes which must be made:Reform and update the existing budget system beginning in Budget2011 taking into account the recommendations of the Joint OireachtasCommittee on Finance and the Public service in its recent report on macroeconomic Policy and effective Fiscal and economic Governance.",303,53620,201102
There will be an extension of Performance Budgeting to identify more  readily  the  results  and  impacts  that  are  expected  to  be  delivered  with public  funds.,303,53620,201102
"New Value for Money rules to spotlight performance, and to assess whether  spending programmes and investment projects are delivering real benefits.",303,53620,201102
"A medium term expenditure framework with multi-annual ceilings on  expenditure in each area, to ensure that public expenditure is managed within fixed, sustainable limits and to guide the planning and delivery of structural and policy reforms.",414,53620,201102
An independent budgetary advisory Council will be established to provide  independent commentary on the government’s budgetary planning.,303,53620,201102
A general emphasis on more sustainable policy planning through a legal  provision to require multi-annual planning and automatic adjustments based  on revenue and growth figures.,303,53620,201102
We believe that ireland has a strong public service which compares well internationally.,601,53620,201102
"However, the scale and pace of change in work practices and public expectations combine with the fiscal crisis to mean that there must be further significant reform in the delivery of public services.",303,53620,201102
Complete the programme of reduction of public service staff numbers for  each sector to bring the overall reduction to 8%.,303,53620,201102
Reform work practices to provide more efficient public services with  scarcer  resources.,303,53620,201102
The public service will be smaller and more efficient.,303,53620,201102
Performance of individuals and organisations will be better managed and  measured.,303,53620,201102
Organisations will be restructured so that public bodies and public servants  will be able to work across different sectors and organisations.,303,53620,201102
"Within the civil service, transfer across departmental boundaries should  become common, and transfers should involve both promotions and more regular reassignments.",303,53620,201102
The strategic plans of departments should be summarised in accessible  form  and  examined  by  an  oireachtas  Government  oversight  Committee every  year.,303,53620,201102
Each Department should have a small supervisory board drawn from  outside  the  department  which  would  review  management  performance and  internal  audit.,303,53620,201102
Where  a  bonus  scheme  exists  payments  should  be cleared  by  this  board.,303,53620,201102
The annual report of each department should include all significant  corporate governance issues which have emerged within the department or its agencies together with the actions taken to tackle them.,303,53620,201102
We support the introduction of more formal controls of officials and others  moving into the private sector including a ‘cooling-off’ period.,304,53620,201102
"In addition, we support the introduction of a formal register of persons  lobbying government.",304,53620,201102
We will examine ways to increase external recruitment.,303,53620,201102
"However, the priority  will  be  to  address  the  need  for  expert  staff  in  oversight  and  policy  roles.",303,53620,201102
We will replace the Top Level Appointments Commission with a body more  independent of the senior public service.,303,53620,201102
there is already a substantial process of strategic planning and evaluation in place within the public service.,303,53620,201102
"We believe that it is essential to see the process for extending outcomes, evaluation and accountability as a collaborative one.",303,53620,201102
We will revise the Ministers & Secretaries Act to clarify and update the  assignment of accountability within the public service.,303,53620,201102
"in the first instance, this process would be led by the new Dáil Government oversight Committee which we are proposing.",303,53620,201102
Setting measureable outcomes is a key part of ensuring performance.,303,53620,201102
"However, it is also possible to have targets overload.",303,53620,201102
therefore we will simplify the performance management procedures within each department and require that each strategy statement and evaluation be reviewed by the relevant Dáil Committee within one month of publication.,303,53620,201102
in order to drive this programme of reform across government we will appoint a minister of state for public service reform with the right to attend cabinet.,303,53620,201102
"We support changes to workings of local authorities which will increase the sharing services between councils, extend the provision of information to residents and enhance democratic accountability.",303,53620,201102
We will publish further details of these measures during the campaign.,303,53620,201102
the areas covered by state agencies are increasingly complex and the need for improved strategic oversight and corporate governance is clear.,303,53620,201102
We therefore support a significant series of changes to the operation of the system of constructing state boards.,303,53620,201102
We support a review of the membership of all state boards.,303,53620,201102
In particular  we acknowledge that many are too large and do not include a sufficient diversity of skills.,303,53620,201102
o  as a general rule we support the introduction of a limit of ten ordinary members plus a chairman for the membership of boards which have core supervisory functions.,303,53620,201102
o  each minister should prepare and publish a statement of the skills and roles sought for each board.,303,53620,201102
this will provide the framework within which appointed decisions can be made and reviewed.,303,53620,201102
o   each appointment to a public body should be reviewed by an independent board to work alongside the Judicial Appointments Board.,304,53620,201102
they should be charged with certifying the suitability of potential appointees.,304,53620,201102
Government should be precluded from appointing a person who fails to be so certified.,304,53620,201102
o  the board shall maintain an online register of appointments.,303,53620,201102
it shall be notified of all vacancies as they arise and advertise them online.,304,53620,201102
members of the public will be entitled to submit their names for consideration.,303,53620,201102
"o  Where appropriate in order to broaden critical expertise and increase the independence of members, appointments may be made of persons living outside the state.",303,53620,201102
qualification for the position and role should be published.,304,53620,201102
o  We support a statutory provision for gender balance in appointments which will also extend to external nominations.,706,53620,201102
"o  We do not support the introduction of a process of oireachtas confirmation as we believe that, where they exist, such procedures inevitably lead to destructive partisanship.",305,53620,201102
A board must be able to carry out its functions solely in the public interest.,304,53620,201102
"In many cases the current ‘representative’ nature of various boards, where  interest groups nominate members is unsuitable.",304,53620,201102
"it should be more limited, possibly being restructured into separate supervisory and consultative boards.",303,53620,201102
Every board shall publish before March of each year an annual report on  its own activities as opposed to the wider work of the state body.,303,53620,201102
the Chairman may be examined on this by the oireachtas oversight Committee.,303,53620,201102
The C&AG will be asked to include a specific section in his annual reports  about the corporate governance systems put in place by each board including the effectiveness of the audit committees.,303,53620,201102
o  Where a specific shortcoming in corporate governance systems has been identified a board will be obliged to report regularly on efforts to improve these systems.,303,53620,201102
Ireland is at a crossroads.,606,53951,201102
This election will be one of the most important ever held.,606,53951,201102
Fianna Fáil and the Greens have ruined the economy.,305,53951,201102
"440,000 citizens are unemployed;",701,53951,201102
"100,000 more people will emigrate over the next two years.",701,53951,201102
Families are at risk of losing their homes.,706,53951,201102
"Our elderly and disabled, low-income and middle-income families, our urban and rural communities and small businesses, have all been badly hurt by the bad decisions of this incompetent Government.",706,53951,201102
Our sovereignty has been handed over to the IMF,601,53951,201102
"and EU and the banking debt has become the personal debt of every man, woman and child in the State.",415,53951,201102
This is wrong.,415,53951,201102
There is a better way to reduce the deficit and put our economy back on track without cutting the heart out of society,415,53951,201102
"and destroying our education, health and social services.",504,53951,201102
If we are to fix this our society we need to put honesty and fairness into politics.,304,53951,201102
"We need people in the Dáil who are there to represent the best interests of citizens, not the banks or themselves.",304,53951,201102
We need people who put job creation and quality public services first – who will make sure the ordinary person and the most vulnerable in society are protected.,409,53951,201102
"All that is still possible, even in these difficult times.",305,53951,201102
But it means political choices.,305,53951,201102
Fianna Fáil’s and the Greens’ savage Budget targeted working families and those on low and middle incomes.,305,53951,201102
"And, despite their rhetoric, Labour and Fine Gael have both said that they intend to implement the policies produced by the Government.",305,53951,201102
"Four years ago, these parties were also saying the same thing – cut taxes, increase spending and give more power to the EU.",305,53951,201102
"Four years ago, Sinn Féin said the fundamentals were not sound and that the Government was throwing away billions instead of investing in the future.",305,53951,201102
"We proposed introducing a fair tax system,",503,53951,201102
"using available public finance to create a world-class health and education system,",504,53951,201102
"immediate measures to deal with a growing crisis in property and banking, the ending of cronyism and double standards.",305,53951,201102
We said use the boom to build a society that we can really be proud of.,504,53951,201102
"Today we are the only party to have produced costed, alternative economic proposals that have been endorsed by independent economists.",305,53951,201102
a) Invest in a major job-creation programme to get Ireland back to work;,409,53951,201102

and education systems;,506,53951,201102

h) Continued support for the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement,106,53951,201102
Over the last year Sinn Féin has confronted the Government and demanded higher standards.,305,53951,201102
"For us, actions speak louder than words.",305,53951,201102
» Sinn Féin was the only party not to sign up to the Fianna Fáil/Green Party/Fine Gael/Labour ‘Consensus for Cuts’ and instead put forward a real alternative for economic recovery.,305,53951,201102
"»It was Sinn Féin which first called on  Ceann Comhairle John O’Donoghue  to resign, saying his position was  untenable after the revelations about  his lavish expenses.",304,53951,201102
Only then did the  other Opposition parties speak out.,305,53951,201102
It was Limerick City Sinn Féin Councillor Maurice Quinlivan who confronted the slíbhín politics of Minister Willie O’Dea.,305,53951,201102
» It was the decision of Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty to go to the courts to vindicate the rights of the people of Donegal South-West which forced the Government to hold the long-overdue by-election.,202,53951,201102
» It was Sinn Féin’s Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin TD who exposed Taoiseach Brian Cowen’s contacts with leading people in Anglo Irish Bank.,304,53951,201102
"» It was Sinn Féin which opposed the Lisbon Treaty, pointing out the dangers for our sovereignty.",110,53951,201102
Sinn Féin is an Irish republican party.,601,53951,201102
We are a United Ireland party.,601,53951,201102
"We believe in the sovereignty, independence and freedom of the Irish people and the right of our people to build our own society.",201,53951,201102
Sinn Féin is committed to delivering for citizens.,305,53951,201102
Sinn Féin offers more than just hope in this election – Sinn Féin offers a real alternative.,305,53951,201102
1)  A new Budget as soon as possible following the election.,408,53951,201102
"Close the deficit over 6 years, not 4.",415,53951,201102
"We would envisage a €3billion adjustment for the remainder of 2011 (€4.7billion in a full year), leaving us with a deficit of €15.7billion in 2012.",404,53951,201102
"3)  Restructuring the bank debts, including burning the bank bondholders in those banks which are insolvent, including Anglo Irish Bank.",415,53951,201102
This will ensure tax raised is spent on Irish public services – not servicing or paying off the debt incurred for bailing out the banks.,504,53951,201102
4)  Initiate a responsible wind-down of NAMA.,408,53951,201102
"5)  A €7billion job-creation programme spread over 3.5 years with the aim of saving and creating more than 160,000 jobs funded by a once-off transfer from the National Pension Reserve Fund and which we would use for a stimulus instead of transferring its reserves into the banks.",409,53951,201102
6)  A labour-intensive essential infrastructure programme as part of the €7billion jobstimulus programme.,411,53951,201102

7)  Establishing within the stimulus programme a €600million Jobs Retention Fund.,409,53951,201102
"This fund would subsidise workers in struggling Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with the potential to save 96,000 jobs, akin to the successful model used in Germany.",402,53951,201102
8)  The introduction of a 1% Wealth Tax.,415,53951,201102

17) Ensuring that the unionist community is included at the centre of the debate about the kind of Ireland we want and their place within a united Ireland.,607,53951,201102
Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have brought the country close to economic ruin.,305,53951,201102
"They have introduced five successive Budgets, as well as emergency measures in February 2009, and everything they have done has made the situation worse.",305,53951,201102
Their approach of slash and burn and bailing out the banks has completely failed.,305,53951,201102
The sacrificing of our economic sovereignty to the IMF/EU and the handing over of control of decision-making to them will be disastrous for the economy and society in general.,201,53951,201102
» 2011 will be the fourth consecutive year of declining employment,701,53951,201102
"» By the end of 2011, 300,000 jobs will have been lost since 2007 – there are now 440,000 on the Live Register",701,53951,201102

"» 100,000 more people will emigrate over the next two years",701,53951,201102
» Retail sales (excluding car sales) remain in decline,408,53951,201102
"» The domestic economy, which accounts for 80% of the economy, continues to contract",408,53951,201102
"– the only growth is in exports and most of those exports come from large multinational companies, not home-grown Irish businesses.",407,53951,201102
»  The Government have based their  fiscal plans on 1.75% growth in the  economy which cannot and will  not be achieved under their plans,410,53951,201102
The Government’s economic policy is focused soley on deficit reduction and bailing out the banks.,410,53951,201102
They have left the State without a plan for growth.,410,53951,201102
No plan for growth means no credible plan for deficit reduction.,410,53951,201102
The banks continue to receive our money in the bail-out but have not reinvested it in the State.,410,53951,201102
This money is being put into zombie banks here so that the leading banks of Europe can avoid the consequences of their own reckless lending decisions.,415,53951,201102
"The money is heading straight back out of the country, leaving only increased debts for Irish taxpayers.",415,53951,201102
"It is the banking debt that is plunging us into this debt, not the State’s exchequer finances.",415,53951,201102
Fully nationalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.,413,53951,201102
Introduce a Banking Resolution Bill which protects depositors.,412,53951,201102
Don’t rescue the remaining banks.,401,53951,201102
Introduce a stimulus package.,409,53951,201102
Overhaul the taxation system,408,53951,201102
Eliminate wasteful spending.,303,53951,201102
By taking these steps we will become a good investment for the bond markets.,414,53951,201102
High bond rates and credit rating downgrades show that Ireland is being punished for trying to service an unsustainable debt and by taking on more in the form of the EU/IMF loan.,414,53951,201102
Sinn Féin has put forward an alternative plan for economic recovery which has been endorsed by a number of independent economists.,409,53951,201102
"Our plan is based on job creation,",408,53951,201102
"taxation justice,",503,53951,201102
"an end to wasteful expenditure,",303,53951,201102
"a sensible deficit reduction timetable,",409,53951,201102
the separation of sovereign debt from bank debt and a realistic approach to addressing the banking crisis.,408,53951,201102
The Exchequer deficit is €18.7billion and Sinn Féin aims to close this deficit over a six-year period.,409,53951,201102
Sinn Féin would introduce a new Budget as soon as possible following the election and begin implementing our proposals.,305,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin would introduce a major jobs stimulus package and close the deficit over 6 years, not 4.",409,53951,201102
"We would envisage a €3billion adjustment for the remainder of 2011 (€4.7billion in a full year), leaving us with a deficit of €15.7billion in 2012.",409,53951,201102
"Over the following years, a combination of the new tax measures (and overhauling the system to shut down tax evasion and avoidance loopholes and get rid of tax reliefs), continued savings and the return from a stimulus package (including a growing economy in the private sector),",409,53951,201102
would begin to close the deficit.,414,53951,201102
"For the remainder of 2011, resources from the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and the Exchequer Fund in the Central Bank should be used to run the State.",409,53951,201102
These two bodies hold €30.56billion (€14.9billion in the NPRF and €15.7billion in the Exchequer Fund in the Central Bank) between them.,409,53951,201102
That gives us until the end of 2011 to bring about a banking resolution.,409,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin proposes returning  to the international bond markets in 2012 at the latest with a banking resolution package in place, a growing economy and a declining deficit.",414,53951,201102
By doing this we would restore confidence in the Irish economy with the international bond markets.,414,53951,201102
The reason the bond yields increased was because of an over-exposure to bank debt and Ireland’s commitment to paying back bondholders.,414,53951,201102
This increased interest rates.,414,53951,201102
We need to separate bank debt from sovereign debt.,414,53951,201102
"A quick bank resolution plan, coupled with a radical shift in where Irish funds are diverted, would see bond rates move back to a reasonable rate.",414,53951,201102
Our debt/GDP ratio if we take the banks off the national balance sheet  would be 75%.,414,53951,201102
"The corresponding figures for other European countries are: Greece 126%, Italy 116%, Portugal 76%, France 78% and Germany 73%.",414,53951,201102
The impact of the banking crisis on the public finances has been nothing short of catastrophic.,305,53951,201102
Our domestic public finances can be fixed,414,53951,201102
but we need to start with a change to how we deal with the banking crisis.,305,53951,201102
1) Separate sovereign debt from private bank debt;,401,53951,201102
2)  Abolish the bank guarantee – apply a market solution to a market problem;,401,53951,201102
3)  Burn the bondholders or allow them to negotiate debt for equity swaps in the smaller banks;,415,53951,201102
4)  Burn Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide bondholders;,415,53951,201102
"5)  Introduce a bank resolution plan that protects depositors and, at the same time, taxpayers;",412,53951,201102
6)  Complete the nationalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland and convert the two into a merged state bank;,413,53951,201102
7)  The responsible wind-down of NAMA.,408,53951,201102
a)  Introduce a new Budget immediately after the election;,408,53951,201102
b)  No further drawing down of the IMF/EU loan;,415,53951,201102
c)  Separate sovereign debt from private bank debt;,412,53951,201102
"d)  Sori out the banking crisis by burning the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, abolishing the guarantee, introducing a bank resolution plan that protects depositors,",401,53951,201102
and completing the nationalisation of Bank of Ireland and AIB;,413,53951,201102
e)  Reverse savage cuts imposed in the Fianna Fáil/Green Party December 2010 Budget which unfairly targeted those on low and middle incomes and were extremely deflationary;,504,53951,201102
f)  €7billion for a 3.5-year employment/ infrastructure provision stimulus package to to get Ireland back to work,409,53951,201102
– €2billion of this to be used for employment stimulus in 2011;,409,53951,201102
g)  A €595million financial stimulus initiative from current spending;,409,53951,201102
"h)  Reduce the deficit over six years beginning with a €3billion reduction for the remainder of 2011 through a combination of the new tax measures (and more overhauls such as shutting down tax evasion and avoidance loopholes and getting rid of tax reliefs), continued savings and the return from a stimulus package (including increased tax revenues from growth in the private sector);",409,53951,201102
i)  In 2012 our proposals would see a total deficit reduction of €4.2billion and we would go into 2013 with a deficit of €11.5billion;,409,53951,201102
"j)  Return to the markets in 2012 at the latest – If we take the banks off the State’s balance sheet, the debt/GDP ratio of Ireland falls below that of Belgium, which raised money in December at 1.8%;",401,53951,201102
"k)   Over the next four years – 2013 to 2016 inclusive – our stimulus package returns a total of €15billion (as set out in our pre-Budget submission appendices) in revenue returns, social welfare savings and economy growth.",409,53951,201102
Year after year our new taxation measures would increase the tax-take further and we would seek additional spending savings where achievable in a fair and efficient manner.,415,53951,201102
Jobs can be created.,701,53951,201102
The solutions exist.,701,53951,201102
Creating jobs has to be at the core of any economic recovery plan.,701,53951,201102
"By December 2010, over 440,000 people were unemployed.",701,53951,201102
Many people are struggling to survive on decreasing dole and social welfare payments while increasing numbers are emigrating.,504,53951,201102
"Reminiscent of the 1950s and 1980s, a whole generation of young people sees no future in the country and they are leaving.",706,53951,201102
"The ESRI has warned that up to 60,000 will leave by the end of this year and a further 40,000 next year if employment levels do not improve.",701,53951,201102
"Our job creation proposals are based on providing immediate and direct employment in key sectors such as infrastructure – building schools, health facilities,",408,53951,201102
"improving secondary roads and public transport, and rolling out broadband – creating employment, particularly for those affected by the construction sector crash.",411,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin will also focus on creating new jobs across the agri-food, tourism and IT/pharma sectors, and Research and Development as well as with initiatives that will ensure Ireland becomes a world leader in green energy.",701,53951,201102
This will improve the State’s competitiveness in addition to providing us with world-class infrastructure to attract Foreign Direct Investment and support indigenous enterprise for longerterm employment creation.,410,53951,201102
This sustainable long-term employment would broaden and secure the tax base.,410,53951,201102
"A €7billion job-creation programme spread over 3.5 years with the aim of saving and creating more than 160,000 jobs.",409,53951,201102
"This will be funded by a onceoff transfer from the National Pension Reserve Fund, which we would use for a stimulus instead of transferring its reserves into the banks.",409,53951,201102
b)  A labour-intensive essential infrastructure programme as part of the €7billion jobstimulus programme.,411,53951,201102
"The focus of this programme would be to build hospitals, schools, water infrastructure, public transport networks and to roll out broadband State-wide.",411,53951,201102
c)  Establish within the stimulus programme a €600million Jobs Retention Fund.,409,53951,201102
"This fund would subsidise workers in struggling Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with the potential to save 96,000 jobs, akin to the successful model used in Germany.",402,53951,201102
d)   Create employment through the construction and delivery of childcare services.,504,53951,201102
"There is a significant deficit which, if unaddressed, will be an impediment to economic recovery.",504,53951,201102
e)  A new generation of co-operatives.,405,53951,201102
Provide start-up funding and other support co-operatives as a viable choice for start-up businesses and the conversion to co-operatives as an alternative to closure for struggling businesses.,405,53951,201102
f)  Jobs created for the under-25s.,706,53951,201102
"A Youth Jobs Fund to create 20,000 new jobs and an individual plan for the long-term prospects of every person under 25 who is on the Live Register.",706,53951,201102
"g)  Boost employment in the tourism sector by developing tourist attractions, including cultural tourism attractions, amenities for those interested in adventure sport and attractions for children and young people.",502,53951,201102
"Implement steps to make Ireland the top destination for those who want a clean, green tourist destination in Europe.",502,53951,201102
Target emerging and different/niche markets.,408,53951,201102
"h)  Grow the agri-food sector by implementing the proposals in the report produced by Sinn Féin TD Arthur Morgan for the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.",703,53951,201102
These proposals include funding and support central production hubs for SMEs involved in the agri-food sector.,402,53951,201102
i)  Employ apprentices on public projects.,411,53951,201102
Make the employment of a set amount of apprentices a condition on which public contracts are awarded to contractors building public infrastructure to help address the crisis in non-completed apprenticeships due to the construction sector collapse.,411,53951,201102
j)  Create a new generation of entrepreneurs.,402,53951,201102
"Do this by changing the PRSI system to create a safety net for those who attempt to establish their own business, launching a National Entrepreneurship Programme with incubation centres around the country and doubling the target for supporting High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) from 200 to 400 per year.",402,53951,201102
"k)  Break up local authority and public sector construction, service and procurement contracts to create a level pitch for small businesses to tender.",403,53951,201102
l)   A ‘Sales Ireland’ strategy to help Irish firms increase exports to markets outside the US and Britain.,407,53951,201102
"Assist Irish firms looking to set up manufacturing businesses with the potential to compete with our largest imports, including through the provision of R&D funding.",407,53951,201102
m)  A publicly-owned national green technology firm for Ireland that would manage and use the island’s energy resources.,413,53951,201102
"To be established within 12 months, it would be an energy provider and funder gathering expertise and resources to make Ireland energy independent by 2020.",413,53951,201102
Cost: approximately €100million.,413,53951,201102
"n)  Increase and enhancing CE schemes, making the schemes more relevant for the needs of society, economy and the community.",701,53951,201102
o)   Initiate a ‘Front Line Services Aides Scheme’ where young people are employed to take on specific work from overworked front-line workers (e.g. civilianising administrative work that is currently done by Gardaí).,706,53951,201102
p)  Enhance Government-backed ‘Buy Irish’ campaign and ‘Shop Local’ campaigns.,407,53951,201102
"q)  To reduce the pressure on retailers, end upward-only rent reviews for business premises.",402,53951,201102
"r)  A radical overhaul of FÁS to ensure that the courses and assistance which it provides are relevant to the needs of job seekers and the economy, including being orientated towards growth sectors in the economy.",411,53951,201102
"People across Ireland are struggling to pay bills, meet rising mortgage costs and survive on incomes which have drastically fallen due to unemployment and pay cuts.",504,53951,201102
Social welfare rates have been cut.,504,53951,201102
ESB and gas prices are rising.,504,53951,201102
The minimum wage has been cut and this will have knock-on consequences on other low-paid workers.,412,53951,201102
"Even in times of severe economic difficulties the Government must ensure that everyone has a decent standard of income, whether that is through wages earned in employment or through social protection payments.",412,53951,201102
Reducing poverty has to be a core aim of Government.,410,53951,201102
This will require enhanced education,506,53951,201102
and employment opportunities and improved income supports.,412,53951,201102
"Countries which are successful in reducing poverty have comprehensive welfare systems, high payment rates and high employment rates.",504,53951,201102
"As soon as economic conditions permit new, longer-term benchmarks against which the evolution of social welfare rates can be measured should to be set.",412,53951,201102
"In addition, reducing payments to the incomes of those who spend everything takes money out of the local and national economies and is deflationary which in turn leads to more job losses.",504,53951,201102
Cuts in expenditure and tax increases need to be centred on the areas where they have the most positive impact on the economy.,410,53951,201102
Sinn Féin is committed to stopping any downward pressure for the working and middle classes on wages,415,53951,201102
"and reducing the major costs facing households, including the amount that those on low and average incomes pay on mortgage repayments and rent.",412,53951,201102
We will strengthen workers’ rights protection to prevent wages being driven down.,701,53951,201102
We will reduce the social welfare bill by creating jobs rather than by cutting payments.,504,53951,201102
Pushing people into poverty will not lift us out of recession.,504,53951,201102
a)  Restore the minimum wage at €8.65 an hour.,412,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin has proposed other measures that can be applied to help viable businesses legitimately struggling to keep people employed, such as our Jobs Retention Fund.",402,53951,201102
b)  Oppose attempts by employers to unilaterally opt-out of agreed wage rates.,701,53951,201102
"c)  Remove the income levy from lowearners in the ‘no-tax’ bracket, reverse the Universal Social Charge and keep minimum wage earners out of the tax bracket.",503,53951,201102
"d)  Immediately return social welfare payments to 2010 levels, and as soon as economic conditions permit raise them further to ensure adequate incomes (no one below the poverty line).",504,53951,201102
e)  Protect the social welfare fund by working to end fraud and creating jobs to get people off the dole.,504,53951,201102
f)  Restore the Christmas Bonus social welfare payment.,504,53951,201102
g)  Restore Child Benefit to 2010 levels.,504,53951,201102
"h)  Improving the social welfare system to ensure support is given to people seeking financial help in an holistic way – ensure a decent standard of living, access to childcare when job seeking, studying or training and, when employed, the provision of skills training and counselling where needed.",504,53951,201102
"i)  New guidelines, protocols and training around the ‘habitual residence’ condition to ensure that returned Irish emigrants are not wrongly denied social welfare.",504,53951,201102
Centralise application data to ensure geographical consistency in decisionmaking.,504,53951,201102
j)  Improve the PRSI system to ensure employers are contributing fairly to their employees’ welfare (Irish employers contribute the least in Europe to their employees’ social protection).,504,53951,201102
"k)  A cap on utility prices, including electricity and gas, for a minimum of three years and a reduction where possible.",412,53951,201102
"l)  Maintaining VAT at its current rate, with eventual decreases of this regressive taxation.",408,53951,201102
m) Ensure a percentage is allocated from the carbon tax income fund in order to specifically address energy poverty and subsidise energy efficiency measures for the lowest-income groups.,415,53951,201102
"Introducing compensatory measures to offset the carbon tax for low-income families, as demanded by social justice groups across the State.",415,53951,201102
"n)  Introduce a Cost of Disability Payment on a phased basis, to offset extra costs related to disability and in recognition of disproportionate rates of poverty and unemployment among people with disabilities.",705,53951,201102
"The purpose of the tax system is to collect finances to run the State, including providing services like health, education, justice and social welfare.",408,53951,201102
A good tax system is fair – it taxes those who can afford it most and asks for less from those who cannot afford it.,503,53951,201102
"In this State, the tax system has been undermined as a result of changes introduced by successive governments leaving us in a position where the tax-take is insufficient to fund basic public services.",503,53951,201102
"Fianna Fáil has steadily reduced direct taxation (income taxes) on the better-off while increasing flat taxes (VAT and rates), which is regressive and impacts most on ordinary people.",503,53951,201102
The introduction of a Universal Social Charge in Budget 2011 and the lowering of the tax bands to bring more people into the tax net and more lower-earners into the marginal higher tax rate of 41% has unfairly targeted the least-well-off for tax increases and lessened these groups’ disposable income – doing more damage in the long-run to the State’s finances.,503,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin believes in providing high-quality, free at the point of delivery public services and these must be paid for.",504,53951,201102
This State does not have a spending problem in its structural finances;,504,53951,201102
it has a tax-raising and retention problem.,408,53951,201102
"Many people made vast fortunes during the Celtic Tiger era, much of which was under-taxed due to the extent of tax breaks available.",503,53951,201102
We believe that those who can afford it should be asked to pay more.,503,53951,201102
Sinn Féin is also advocating tax harmonisation across the island so we can remove a dual system that penalises border businesses and citizens and impedes the development of an all-island economy.,601,53951,201102
"a)   Restructure the bank debts, including burning the bank bondholders in those banks which are insolvent, including Anglo Irish Bank.",404,53951,201102
This will ensure tax raised is spent on Irish public services– not servicing or paying off the debt incurred for bailing out the banks.,504,53951,201102
b)  The introduction of a 1% Wealth Tax.,415,53951,201102
"This would be an income-linked Wealth Tax for high-earners levied on their assets over €1million in value, excluding working farmland. Potential to raise €1billion.",415,53951,201102
"c)  The introduction of a third tax rate of 48% on individual income in excess of three times the average industrial wage (€100,000) per annum.",415,53951,201102
Raises €410million.,415,53951,201102
d)  Standardise all discretionary taxation expenditures (tax reliefs paid at either the standard or marginal rate depending on income) with a view to ultimately eradicating tax reliefs that do not return a value for society.,503,53951,201102
Raises €1.1billion.,503,53951,201102
e)  Increase ‘wealth taxes’: Capital Gains Tax to rise to 40% (15% increase) – raises €240million; and increase Capital Acquisitions Tax to 35% (10% increase).,415,53951,201102
Raises €96million.,415,53951,201102
f)   Abolish mortgage interest relief for landlords. Raises €285million (2009 figure).,408,53951,201102
"g)  Increase tax on second homes to €600 and introduce a tiered tax increase on subsequent homes: e.g. €700 for third homes, €800 for fourth and fifth homes - potential to raise €120million.",415,53951,201102
"h)  Hardship appeals system: Examine the introduction of an income-linked waiver for individuals with second homes who cannot sell them in the current climate, are struggling to meet mortgage repayments or are in financial difficulties.",412,53951,201102
i)  Abolish exemptions including PRSI exemption for share options. Raises €18million.,415,53951,201102
j)  Abolish the income tax exemption for share-option schemes. Raises €3million.,503,53951,201102
k)  Adjust PRSI on share-based remuneration and Capital Gains). Raises €79million.,503,53951,201102
l)  Abolish legacy amounts of property tax reliefs. Potential to raise €400million per annum.,415,53951,201102
"m) In the longer-term, see progressive multiple bands and rates to ensure that those who have the most pay the most.",503,53951,201102
We commit to keeping minimum-wage earners out of the tax net and restoring the standard rate tax band to its 2010 levels.,503,53951,201102
"n)  Reverse the Universal Social Charge and ensure that social insurance is progressive, so that those who have more pay more.",503,53951,201102
o)  Reduce dependence on regressive indirect taxes.,503,53951,201102
Rebalance the tax system to so that it is less dependent on regressive ‘indirect’ taxes such as VAT and stamp duty.,503,53951,201102
p)  End tax breaks and close loopholes abused by higher-earners.,503,53951,201102

t)  Keep the ESB and all other public companies in public ownership.,413,53951,201102
Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new Irish health system with care for all based on need alone.,504,53951,201102
"Our public healthcare system is in crisis because Fianna Fáil-led governments for the past 13 years have been about privatising the health service, and imposing savage cuts.",504,53951,201102
"Operations are being cancelled, public hospital beds are being closed, services are being slashed, frontline healthcare jobs are being cut back and patients are suffering.",504,53951,201102
All this is happening in a two-tier system where wealth can buy you better care in the private health sector – a private sector subsidised by the Government at the expense of the public system.,504,53951,201102
"Even at the height of the boom the health system continued to struggle from crisis to crisis, never properly recovering from the cuts of the 1980s imposed by Governments involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.",504,53951,201102
The HSE has failed because it is top heavy with expensive bureaucracy,303,53951,201102
and is trying to operate an inherently inequitable and inefficient system based on fundamentally flawed policy.,504,53951,201102
Too often the health system has failed the most vulnerable young people in its care.,706,53951,201102
It has failed patients whose illnesses have been misdiagnosed and those who have been left on waiting lists so long that their illness has become terminal.,504,53951,201102
Such failures cannot be accepted.,504,53951,201102
The health system will only be transformed if we have a clear vision of the kind of healthcare citizens deserve.,504,53951,201102
"Doctors, nurses and other health professionals do a great job in circumstances that are increasingly intolerable.",504,53951,201102
It is time to start building a health service that meets the needs of all citizens and that treats them all on a basis of equality.,504,53951,201102
We need a system that has primary and preventative healthcare at its core.,504,53951,201102
"A refocus on primary and preventative healthcare, together with  complementary measures to address the social determinants of ill-health, will over time produce healthcare savings to the Exchequer by reducing the necessity for higher cost acute care in many cases.",504,53951,201102
We will all benefit – the economy will benefit in the long run – if we build a world-class health system.,504,53951,201102

g)  An end to public subsidies for private healthcare.,504,53951,201102

Saves €200million (figure provided by the Department of Health in 2009).,504,53951,201102
"l)  A regular, free, full health screening for every citizens as part of a fundamental reorientation of the health system adopting a central focus on prevention, health promotion and primary care (including mental health care).",504,53951,201102
This will save people from needless suffering and is the best way to avoid more expensive treatments later.,504,53951,201102
"It will also help reduce lost working hours, saving money for workers, businesses and the healthcare system.",504,53951,201102
m) An end to the over-centralisation of hospital facilities and a reversal of cutbacks in services at local hospitals.,504,53951,201102

Sinn Féin believes that children’s rights should be enshrined in the Constitution.,706,53951,201102
Every parent aspires to the best start for their children.,706,53951,201102
We are committed to ensuring that is more than an aspiration – we are committed to delivering the best start for our children.,706,53951,201102
"Free primary, secondary and third-level education is a top priority for Sinn Féin.",506,53951,201102
This will mean eliminating the growing parental contributions and other costs that have undermined the entitlement to free education.,506,53951,201102
We will focus on improving childcare choices for parents in the earliest years of their children’s lives including through the introduction of what is the norm in most European states – a state pre-school system.,706,53951,201102
We will improve the care given to the most vulnerable children.,706,53951,201102

"For more than a decade, Fianna Fáil-led government policies supported and fuelled the development of an unsustainable economic model which became known as the Celtic Tiger.",305,53951,201102
Many of these policies have left us with serious social and economic problems that cannot be left unaddressed.,305,53951,201102
"The legacy of the Celtic Tiger includes ‘ghost’ housing estates, negative equity, an unprecedented banking crisis, unemployment, a personal debt crisis, badly planned towns and a huge Exchequer deficit.",305,53951,201102
These legacy issues for which Government policy is largely responsible have to be addressed if we want to avoid even greater social and economic difficulties into the future.,412,53951,201102
Increasing numbers of homeowners are struggling to pay off mortgages with many others experiencing negative equity.,412,53951,201102

a)  Examine models for mortgage debt forgiveness for those on low and average incomes who are in negative equity and who are in arrears.,412,53951,201102
This would include looking at making available a system of recourse for those struggling to pay their mortgages whose difficulties are primarily the result of reckless lending by financial institutions.,412,53951,201102
Under such a scheme householders should be permitted to hand back the keys and walk away from the mortgage without the debt following them.,412,53951,201102

f)  Prevent future property bubbles by capping land prices zoned for housing and increasing the regulation of banks and all those involved in the property sector.,412,53951,201102
Increasing Capital Gains Tax as proposed earlier would also curb the development of future property bubbles.,415,53951,201102
"g)  A Housing Ombudsman with a remit to monitor and enforce the relevant codes of conduct, provide an effective remedy short of the courts, monitor the implementation of housing and planning legislation, monitor changes in house prices, mortgage payments in arrears, mortgage interest rates and professional fees, and repossessions.",412,53951,201102

Rural communities have been put under threat as a result of Government policy.,305,53951,201102
The erosion of crucial services and the failure to create jobs has meant that emigration and depopulation is a live issue for many parts of rural Ireland once again.,305,53951,201102
"The importance of the rural economy – of farming, fishing, tourism and the growth potential of the renewable energy sector – has not been recognised nor their potential fully developed.",703,53951,201102
Sinn Féin has been very critical of Government policy but we have also put forward our own alternative.,305,53951,201102
Sinn Féin produced three major Oireachtas reports: Awakening the West – Overcoming Social and Economic Inequality; Report on the Future of Farming and Fishing in the West; and Report on the Agri-food Sector.,703,53951,201102
"Sinn Féin is committed to protecting the rural way of life, including vital rural services such as bus services, post offices, Garda stations and primary schools.",703,53951,201102
We have put forward realistic proposals to maintain jobs in rural communities.,408,53951,201102

"Transform the rural postal network to make rural post offices a ‘one stop shop’ for a range of services including postal services, banking services, council services and citizens’ information.",411,53951,201102

Public disillusionment with politics has grown as the role of the Government and the Establishment parties in bringing about the economic crisis has become more apparent.,202,53951,201102
"This has been exacerbated by revelations of corruption, outrageous expenses claims and an ineffectual Oireachtas.",304,53951,201102
"The political system is dominated and corrupted by the privileged, paralysed by clientelism and dynastic politics, and resistant to change.",304,53951,201102

Sinn Féin believes that it is time for fundamental political reform.,204,53951,201102
The current system is not fit for purpose.,204,53951,201102
It has brought us ‘boom/bust’ economics and has failed to create a fair society where there is genuine equality of opportunity and outcome.,204,53951,201102
It has not delivered the adequate provision of the essential building blocks of a vibrant and fair society nor the ability to underpin that society with a robust and sustainable economy.,204,53951,201102
"For many citizens, the political institutions on this island are exclusive, inaccessible and unaccountable.",204,53951,201102
